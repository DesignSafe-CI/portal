Single-axis, vertical shaker called Raptor\nEquipment Portfolio\n\n \n\nNHERI@UTexas equipment resources were primarily established with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) under the original George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) program. These equipment resources have served the earthquake engineering community for over 10 years under the name of NEES@UTexas. All equipment operated by NEES@UTexas is now part of NHERI@UTexas. This equipment includes: (1) five, large, hydraulically-controlled shakers that can be used as mobile, wide-band dynamic sources for excitation of geotechnical and structural systems, (2) a tractor-trailer rig used to transport the four largest shakers, (3) a field supply truck for refueling and field maintenance of the mobile shakers, (4) an instrumentation van that houses state-of-the-art data acquisition systems and electrical power generation capabilities, (5) a field instrumentation trailer that has air-conditioned work space and electrical power generation capabilities, and (6) an extensive collection of field instrumentation, DAC systems and a wide range of numerous sensors that are used to measure vibrational motions and pore water pressures.\n\n \n\nThe five mobile shakers offer a wide range in force and frequency generation capabilities. For ease in identifying and referring to the shakers, they have been given the following names: (1) T-Rex, (2) Liquidator, (3) Raptor, (4) Rattler, and (5) Thumper (see photographs in Fig. 1). The two heaviest shakers are T-Rex (29,000 kg) and Liquidator (32,800 kg).\n\n\nFigure 1. Photographs of the five mobile shakers and tractor-trailer rig.\nd. Single-axis, horizontal shaker called Rattler\ne. Urban, three-axis shaker called Thumper\nf. Tractor-trailer rig, called the Big Rig, with T-Rex \nLiquidator\n\nThe second large shaker is Liquidator (Fig. 1b). Liquidator is a custom-built, shaker that was designed specifically for low-frequency, large-motion operation. There is no other shaker like Liquidator in the world. It can be changed from the vertical mode to the cross-line horizontal (shear) mode at the manufacturer’s facilities (IVI in Tulsa, OK) in about two working days. The theoretical force outputs of Liquidator are shown in Fig. 2. The maximum force output in both modes is about 89 kN down to a frequency of 1.3 Hz. However, we have recently developed a new Liquidator testing configuration that allows the entire off-road mobile platform to be lifted off the ground and oscillated in the vertical mode at frequencies between approximately 0.3 - 1.0 Hz. This modified configuration allows Liquidator to generate peak dynamic forces up to 89 kN down to 0.7 Hz. Below 0.7 Hz, the force level decreases but is still substantial to about 0.3 Hz. This modification is a remarkable and completely unique capability that has significant implications for deep (1 km or more), active-source subsurface imaging. Like T-Rex, Liquidator is also mounted on an off-road vehicle and has a penetrometer/instrumentation pushing capability mounted on the rear of the vehicle.\n\n\n\nRaptor &amp; Rattler\n\nThe two, intermediate-level shakers, based on force-generation characteristics and vehicle weight, are Raptor and Rattler. Raptor is a 1982 International Paystar model Y-1100 vertical shaker (Fig. 1c). This type of shaker is called a compression-wave (P-wave) shaker in the geophysical exploration community. The theoretical performance of Raptor is shown in Fig. 2a. The maximum vertical force output is about 120 kN. Raptor is ideal for situations where the force output of Thumper (discussed below) is not sufficient for the desired testing application and the 3-mode shaking capabilities and/or higher force output of T-Rex is not required. The other intermediate-level shaker is Rattler (Fig. 1d). Rattler is a horizontal (shear-wave) vibrator that is a 1980 Mertz Model 13-609 mounted on an off-road vehicle. The theoretical performance of Rattler is shown in Fig. 2b. It has a frequency-force response which is nearly identical to T-Rex in the shear mode. One benefit of having two shear-wave vibrators (T-Rex and Rattler) is that they can be parked side-by-side with their force outputs synchronized to be in phase so that a larger area of high shear strains can be created. Thus, an instrumented portion of soil beneath the two shakers can be excited in a condition closer to plane-strain for in-situ liquefaction and nonlinear soil testing. A similar arrangement can be created in the vertical shaking mode with T-Rex and Raptor. In addition, T-Rex and Rattler can be located next to each other but positioned to permit 2D, horizontal shaking of the ground surface. T-Rex, Liquidator, and Rattler must be transported to and from test sites on the 26-wheel, tractor-trailer rig shown in Fig. 1f. The large size of the tractor-trailer rig, called the Big Rig, is required because both T-Rex and Liquidator create “over-load” situations. Also, due to regulations in some states, Raptor has to be transported with the tractor-trailer rig.\n\nThumper\n\nThumper is the smallest shaker and is built on an International model 4300 truck. Thumper has a moderate force output, which makes it ideal for testing in urban areas. A photograph of Thumper is presented in Fig. 1e, and its theoretical vertical and horizontal frequency-force outputs are shown in Fig. 2. The maximum force output of Thumper is about 27 kN. The direction of shaking with this machine can be changed from vertical to horizontal in about two hours at the test site. T-Rex, Liquidator, and Thumper are also equipped with hydraulic take-off connections that permit each truck to power other hydraulic equipment in the field. For example, T-Rex or Liquidator could be used to power linear hydraulic actuators for in-situ, push-apart, structural testing of piles and drilled piers. Furthermore, the hydraulic shakers mounted on T-Rex, Liquidator, and Thumper can also be removed and attached on a structure. The shakers can then be powered at some stand-off distance by the hydraulic take-off and electronics from the associated mobile platform/truck.\n \n\nFigure 2. Theoretical force outputs of the five mobile shakers available at NHERI@UTexas: (a) vertical force output and (b) horizontal force output.\n\n\n\n\n\nT-Rex\n\nT-Rex (Fig. 1a) is capable of generating large dynamic forces in any of three directions (vertical, horizontal in-line, and horizontal cross-line). To change from one shaking direction to another, the operator simply pushes a button in the driver’s cab. The shaking system is housed on an off-road, all-wheel-drive vehicle. The theoretical force outputs of T-Rex in the vertical and both horizontal directions are shown in Fig. 2a and 2b, respectively. The maximum force output is about 267 kN in the vertical mode and about 134 kN in each horizontal mode. In addition to the significant, 3D load-generation capabilities of T-Rex, this machine also has the capability of pushing cone penetrometers and other custom-made vibration and/or pressure-sensing instrumentation into the ground using a hydraulic ram located at the rear of the vehicle. These overall capabilities make T-Rex unique in the world.\n\n\nField-support vehicles and some of the instrumentation available at NHERI@UTexas are shown in Fig. 3. The first field-support vehicle is a supply truck (see Fig. 3a) that carries diesel fuel for T-Rex, Liquidator, Raptor and Rattler. It also carries spare parts and provides a working platform for maintenance. The second vehicle is an instrumentation van that is a customized Ford cargo van (not shown in Fig. 3). This vehicle provides air-conditioned workspace for personnel, DAC systems, and electrical power. The third support vehicle is a 2.4 m by 4.8 m instrumentation trailer with storage space, air-conditioned workspace and electrical power. A photograph of the instrumentation trailer is shown in Fig. 3a. A photograph of the air-conditioned workspace of the instrumentation trailer is presented in Fig. 3b.\n\nA significant amount of field instrumentation is also part of the NHERI@UTexas equipment facility. This instrumentation includes: (1) two main data acquisition systems (discussed below), (2) 85, 1-Hz vertical geophones (Fig. 3c), (3) 24, 1-Hz horizontal geophones, (4) 6, high-capacity dynamic load cells, (5) 18, triaxial MEMS accelerometers, (6) cone penetrometer test (CPT) and seismic CPT equipment, and (7) 12, 120-seconds Trillium Compact broadband seismometers (see Fig. 3f). The CPT equipment was manufactured by Fugro, Inc. There are four electrical cones, with two of them having a base area of 10 cm2 and the other cones having base areas of 5 cm2 and 15 cm2. A photograph of the CPT equipment in use on the back of T-Rex is presented in Fig. 3d.\n\nThe two main data acquisition systems are: (1) a 64-channel Data Physics spectrum analyzer system, and (2) 10, 3-channel Nanometrics Taurus digitizers (30 total channels). The Data Physics system uses a Microsoft Windows-based software named SignalCal 730 that generates input signals (sinusoidal, stepped-sine, white noise, frequency sweeps, etc.) to drive the mobile shakers and record output signals from various sensors. The Data Physics system actually consists of three dynamic signal analyzers, which can be used individually as two, 16- channel units and one, 32-channel unit, or can be linked together as a single 64-channel system. Fig. 3e shows the setup of the Data Physics Analyzers as 3 separate units with different sampling rates during an in-situ liquefaction test. All sensors are connected to the Data Physics spectrum analyzers by electrical cables. These analyzers have the capacity to record data for long periods of time (hours) at a high sampling rate (up to 200,000 samples per second). Furthermore, the control software, provided by Data Physics Inc., can be used to perform real-time frequency domain calculations and display auto power spectra, transfer functions, coherency and phase plots for reviewing and analyzing data in the field.\n\nIt is not practical for field experiments that utilize widely spread sensors (hundreds of meters to a km apart) to have all sensors connected with electrical cables. Passive surface wave testing and topographic amplification studies represent such experiments that will likely be conducted by researchers using the NHERI@UTexas facilities. In these cases, the Nanometrics Taurus digitizers and Trillium seismometers can be used. The 10, solar-powered Taurus digitizers are self-sustaining recording stations, each with three recording channels. They are designed for long-term deployments such as aftershock monitoring, but can also be used for any type of data acquisition where individual, GPS-synchronized digitizers are required. Although the Nanometrics Taurus digitizers are predominantly used with the Trillium Compact broadband seismometers, other types of sensors can also be connected to the system to monitor strain or displacements of buildings and bridges. Fig. 3f shows a photograph of the Trillium Compact seismometers and Taurus digitizers during a huddle-type calibration test.\n\nFigure 3.

High-force, three-axis shaker called T-Rex\nb. Low-frequency, two-axis shaker called Liquidator\nc. Single-axis, vertical shaker called Raptor\nEquipment Portfolio\n\n \n\nNHERI@UTexas equipment resources were primarily established with funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) under the original George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) program. These equipment resources have served the earthquake engineering community for over 10 years under the name of NEES@UTexas. All equipment operated by NEES@UTexas is now part of NHERI@UTexas. This equipment includes: (1) five, large, hydraulically-controlled shakers that can be used as mobile, wide-band dynamic sources for excitation of geotechnical and structural systems, (2) a tractor-trailer rig used to transport the four largest shakers, (3) a field supply truck for refueling and field maintenance of the mobile shakers, (4) an instrumentation van that houses state-of-the-art data acquisition systems and electrical power generation capabilities, (5) a field instrumentation trailer that has air-conditioned work space and electrical power generation capabilities, and (6) an extensive collection of field instrumentation, DAC systems and a wide range of numerous sensors that are used to measure vibrational motions and pore water pressures.\n\n \n\nThe five mobile shakers offer a wide range in force and frequency generation capabilities. For ease in identifying and referring to the shakers, they have been given the following names: (1) T-Rex, (2) Liquidator, (3) Raptor, (4) Rattler, and (5) Thumper (see photographs in Fig. 1). The two heaviest shakers are T-Rex (29,000 kg) and Liquidator (32,800 kg).\n\n\nFigure 1. Photographs of the five mobile shakers and tractor-trailer rig.\nd. Single-axis, horizontal shaker called Rattler\ne. Urban, three-axis shaker called Thumper\nf. Tractor-trailer rig, called the Big Rig, with T-Rex \nLiquidator\n\nThe second large shaker is Liquidator (Fig. 1b). Liquidator is a custom-built, shaker that was designed specifically for low-frequency, large-motion operation. There is no other shaker like Liquidator in the world. It can be changed from the vertical mode to the cross-line horizontal (shear) mode at the manufacturer’s facilities (IVI in Tulsa, OK) in about two working days. The theoretical force outputs of Liquidator are shown in Fig. 2. The maximum force output in both modes is about 89 kN down to a frequency of 1.3 Hz. However, we have recently developed a new Liquidator testing configuration that allows the entire off-road mobile platform to be lifted off the ground and oscillated in the vertical mode at frequencies between approximately 0.3 - 1.0 Hz. This modified configuration allows Liquidator to generate peak dynamic forces up to 89 kN down to 0.7 Hz. Below 0.7 Hz, the force level decreases but is still substantial to about 0.3 Hz. This modification is a remarkable and completely unique capability that has significant implications for deep (1 km or more), active-source subsurface imaging. Like T-Rex, Liquidator is also mounted on an off-road vehicle and has a penetrometer/instrumentation pushing capability mounted on the rear of the vehicle.\n\n\n\nRaptor &amp; Rattler\n\nThe two, intermediate-level shakers, based on force-generation characteristics and vehicle weight, are Raptor and Rattler. Raptor is a 1982 International Paystar model Y-1100 vertical shaker (Fig. 1c). This type of shaker is called a compression-wave (P-wave) shaker in the geophysical exploration community. The theoretical performance of Raptor is shown in Fig. 2a. The maximum vertical force output is about 120 kN. Raptor is ideal for situations where the force output of Thumper (discussed below) is not sufficient for the desired testing application and the 3-mode shaking capabilities and/or higher force output of T-Rex is not required. The other intermediate-level shaker is Rattler (Fig. 1d). Rattler is a horizontal (shear-wave) vibrator that is a 1980 Mertz Model 13-609 mounted on an off-road vehicle. The theoretical performance of Rattler is shown in Fig. 2b. It has a frequency-force response which is nearly identical to T-Rex in the shear mode. One benefit of having two shear-wave vibrators (T-Rex and Rattler) is that they can be parked side-by-side with their force outputs synchronized to be in phase so that a larger area of high shear strains can be created. Thus, an instrumented portion of soil beneath the two shakers can be excited in a condition closer to plane-strain for in-situ liquefaction and nonlinear soil testing. A similar arrangement can be created in the vertical shaking mode with T-Rex and Raptor. In addition, T-Rex and Rattler can be located next to each other but positioned to permit 2D, horizontal shaking of the ground surface. T-Rex, Liquidator, and Rattler must be transported to and from test sites on the 26-wheel, tractor-trailer rig shown in Fig. 1f. The large size of the tractor-trailer rig, called the Big Rig, is required because both T-Rex and Liquidator create “over-load” situations. Also, due to regulations in some states, Raptor has to be transported with the tractor-trailer rig.\n\nThumper\n\nThumper is the smallest shaker and is built on an International model 4300 truck. Thumper has a moderate force output, which makes it ideal for testing in urban areas. A photograph of Thumper is presented in Fig. 1e, and its theoretical vertical and horizontal frequency-force outputs are shown in Fig. 2. The maximum force output of Thumper is about 27 kN. The direction of shaking with this machine can be changed from vertical to horizontal in about two hours at the test site. T-Rex, Liquidator, and Thumper are also equipped with hydraulic take-off connections that permit each truck to power other hydraulic equipment in the field. For example, T-Rex or Liquidator could be used to power linear hydraulic actuators for in-situ, push-apart, structural testing of piles and drilled piers. Furthermore, the hydraulic shakers mounted on T-Rex, Liquidator, and Thumper can also be removed and attached on a structure. The shakers can then be powered at some stand-off distance by the hydraulic take-off and electronics from the associated mobile platform/truck.\n \n\nFigure 2.

{"_index":"cms","_type":"modelresult","_id":"cms.page.439","_score":1,"_source":{"body":"Experimental Protocol\n\n \n\nThe geotechnical centrifuge is a laboratory where researchers perform experiments by remote control in an increased gravity field. Researchers at UC Davis most often perform shaking table tests and/or reaction wall/field loading type tests on models while they spin. Experimental protocols for the 9-m and 1-m radius centrifuges are similar in structure but differ dramatically in complexity.\n\nPretest planning: The first stage in the experimental protocol is the Experiment Conceptual Design. This stage is typically an iterative collaboration between the project PI, research team, and CGM senior personnel. During this phase, we match research objectives with experimental capabilities and available resources. In most projects, we are asked to do something different than we have done before and hence need to confirm the feasibility of new developments.\n\nThe research team then develops and presents a written Experimental Plan to the CGM prior to arrival on site. The Experimental Plan details plans for model construction, instrumentation, and testing. The CGM uses the plan to schedule facility resources and guide the development of any required custom testing capabilities. All custom testing capabilities must be complete before model construction begins.\n\nUpon arrival on site, researchers present their Experimental Plan at a meeting of the CGM staff and any other research teams already on site. This meeting facilitates teamwork, identifies critical path elements and any conflicting needs of different research teams, ensures best practices, is an opportunity for discussion of safety and risks, and ensures roles and responsibilities are well understood. The research team may then begin building their model to be tested on the centrifuge.\n\nSensors and instrumentation: Researchers often begin model construction in the Electronics and Calibration Room (clean shop) where they check out, calibrate and verify sensors from the CGM inventory. Teams often install and test their own custom strain gauge bridges or other custom sensors on model structures. The work on electronics, instrumentation, and calibration can last anywhere from two days for simple experiments to a month or two if many strain-gauge bridges are installed, wired, and calibrated by a small team or individual.\nWork in the model prep room: Placing soil and sensors in a model container is done in the model preparation room. Sand is generally placed at a controlled density using pluviators. Clay is most often consolidated from slurry using one of our hydraulic presses. The soil profile is carefully constructed over the course of days to weeks. Researchers install and document locations of dozens of sensors within the soil mass while they fill the container. Researchers then install any model structures (e.g., a model building with model foundations in the soil), mount sensor racks, and place sensors on the structures and container. Researchers must complete all possible tasks in the model preparation room before the model is moved onto the arm. If a team identifies a last-minute modification they wish to make, their model waits in the model preparation room while they complete the modification. We have found that this rule reduces on-arm delays when teams are building models in parallel because it allows the second team to leapfrog the first team. Model construction can range from two to eight weeks for the 9-m centrifuge.\nFinal work on the centrifuge arm: After moving the assembled model to the centrifuge, the sample may be saturated, instrument racks installed and adjusted, and sensors connected to the DAQ. Users verify each sensor and each DAQ connection as part of their preparation protocol. The on-arm preparation stage typically requires three to ten days for the 9-m centrifuge.\nSpinning and testing the model: Once the model is prepped for flight, the centrifuge experiment may be executed. The test protocol involves increasing the centrifuge speed to the target scaling level, performing a series of site characterization studies (e.g., cone penetration tests, bender element tests), and executing a series of simulated seismic events. In non-seismic tests, model structures may be loaded statically or cyclically using servo-hydraulic actuators. Spinning up to the target centrifugal acceleration takes about an hour, and each event in the experiment typically takes 30 minutes to an hour depending on how much interaction in decision making is required to proceed to the next stage of the experiment. Researchers are encouraged to check that their instruments continue to function reliably at each stage of the experiment. Each spin consist of a series of several simulated earthquake events and/or site characterization tests and each project often requires multiple spins spanning a few days to a few weeks on the 9-m centrifuge.\n\nDissection: Following the centrifuge test, users dissect the model in a process that typically takes one to two weeks for the 9-m centrifuge. As they meticulously log the final state of their model, users carefully remove the sensors, discard waste soil, and clean the model container and model preparation area. Sensors are given to CGM staff for cleaning, testing, and returning to inventory.\n\nData Archiving: The final stage in the experiment protocol, from the facility perspective, is the archiving of experimental data. The CGM has example data reports from which users can draw upon to create their own data log. The CGM DAQ systems include configuration spreadsheets with metadata, and users share standard sensor plan template spreadsheets where common metadata is structured following well-established procedures. The result has been a high compliance by our users to data archiving and sharing requirements/commitments. Analysis of the data produced in one experiment will typically keep at least one graduate student busy for a year; a PhD thesis typically includes two or three experiments.\n ","django_id":"439","title":"Experimental Protocol","url":"https://ucdavis.designsafe-ci.org/experimental-protocol","text":"Experimental Protocol\n\n \n\nThe geotechnical centrifuge is a laboratory where researchers perform experiments by remote control in an increased gravity field. Researchers at UC Davis most often perform shaking table tests and/or reaction wall/field loading type tests on models while they spin. Experimental protocols for the 9-m and 1-m radius centrifuges are similar in structure but differ dramatically in complexity.\n\nPretest planning: The first stage in the experimental protocol is the Experiment Conceptual Design. This stage is typically an iterative collaboration between the project PI, research team, and CGM senior personnel. During this phase, we match research objectives with experimental capabilities and available resources. In most projects, we are asked to do something different than we have done before and hence need to confirm the feasibility of new developments.\n\nThe research team then develops and presents a written Experimental Plan to the CGM prior to arrival on site. The Experimental Plan details plans for model construction, instrumentation, and testing. The CGM uses the plan to schedule facility resources and guide the development of any required custom testing capabilities. All custom testing capabilities must be complete before model construction begins.\n\nUpon arrival on site, researchers present their Experimental Plan at a meeting of the CGM staff and any other research teams already on site. This meeting facilitates teamwork, identifies critical path elements and any conflicting needs of different research teams, ensures best practices, is an opportunity for discussion of safety and risks, and ensures roles and responsibilities are well understood. The research team may then begin building their model to be tested on the centrifuge.\n\nSensors and instrumentation: Researchers often begin model construction in the Electronics and Calibration Room (clean shop) where they check out, calibrate and verify sensors from the CGM inventory. Teams often install and test their own custom strain gauge bridges or other custom sensors on model structures. The work on electronics, instrumentation, and calibration can last anywhere from two days for simple experiments to a month or two if many strain-gauge bridges are installed, wired, and calibrated by a small team or individual.\nWork in the model prep room: Placing soil and sensors in a model container is done in the model preparation room. Sand is generally placed at a controlled density using pluviators. Clay is most often consolidated from slurry using one of our hydraulic presses. The soil profile is carefully constructed over the course of days to weeks. Researchers install and document locations of dozens of sensors within the soil mass while they fill the container. Researchers then install any model structures (e.g., a model building with model foundations in the soil), mount sensor racks, and place sensors on the structures and container. Researchers must complete all possible tasks in the model preparation room before the model is moved onto the arm. If a team identifies a last-minute modification they wish to make, their model waits in the model preparation room while they complete the modification. We have found that this rule reduces on-arm delays when teams are building models in parallel because it allows the second team to leapfrog the first team. Model construction can range from two to eight weeks for the 9-m centrifuge.\nFinal work on the centrifuge arm: After moving the assembled model to the centrifuge, the sample may be saturated, instrument racks installed and adjusted, and sensors connected to the DAQ. Users verify each sensor and each DAQ connection as part of their preparation protocol. The on-arm preparation stage typically requires three to ten days for the 9-m centrifuge.\nSpinning and testing the model: Once the model is prepped for flight, the centrifuge experiment may be executed. The test protocol involves increasing the centrifuge speed to the target scaling level, performing a series of site characterization studies (e.g., cone penetration tests, bender element tests), and executing a series of simulated seismic events. In non-seismic tests, model structures may be loaded statically or cyclically using servo-hydraulic actuators.

The approach combines the accuracy of physical wind tunnel testing with the efficient exploration of a solution space using numerical optimization algorithms. The approach is fully automated, with experiments executed in a boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT), sensor feedback monitored by a high-performance computer (HPC), and optimization techniques used to bring about physical changes in the BLWT. Anticipated outcomes include: (1) the combination of high-fidelity experimental testing and numerically-driven optimization for wind engineering, (2) the advancement of optimization in a practical engineering setting, and (3) the discovery of new design and detailing features to achieve cost-effective structures.\nInitial studies focus on a low-rise structure with parapet wall of variable height, adjusted at the model-scale using servo-motors. Parapets are common on industrial and commercial buildings and have a non-monotonic influence on a structure’s wind load. The model surface is instrumented with pressure taps to measure the envelope pressure. Design objectives include the mitigation of extreme roof loading and the creation of an efficient structural system. Implications of this proof-of-concept are significant for more complex structures where the optimal solution cannot be reasonably determined with traditional experimental or computational methods.\n\nThis project is funded by NSF under Grant No. 1636039 and uses the BLWT and HPC resources of the University of Florida NHERI Site under NSF Grant No. 1520843.

Ten broadband (120 s – 100 Hz), three-component Trillium Compact microtremor stations available at NHERI@UTexas were deployed for the passive surface wave measurements. \n\n \n\nCollecting Data\n\nThe goal of the study is to characterize the shearing stiffness of both near-surface (top several meters) and deep (down to several hundred meters) materials in the vicinity of existing surface and borehole accelerometers. These accelerometers have recorded numerous ground motions and can be used to compute how ground motions recorded within bedrock are amplified or attenuated by the overlying soils as they travel to the surface. With a robust characterization of the shearing stiffness profile down to bedrock, the frequency-dependent amplification or attenuation can also be predicted using seismic site response analyses and the results compared to the measured ground response.\n\nThis dataset will be used to establish a “site signature” for the GVDA site, which will allow for realistic quantification of shear wave velocity (Vs) uncertainty in seismic site response analyses.  It is hoped that more realistic estimates of Vs uncertainty will contribute to better comparisons between calculated and recorded site response at the GVDA.\n\n “Traditionally, surface wave methods (SWM’s) have been used to provide a single, deterministic shear wave velocity (Vs) profile for each site tested, without consideration given to uncertainty,” Cox says. “However, as our profession moves toward probabilistic design and performance-based engineering, the inability to quantify uncertainty in Vs from SWM’s has been exposed as a major impediment to future progress.” \n\n \n\nQuantifying Uncertainty\n\nCox’s DIPS plan is revolutionary in its aim to “smooth out the dips” in SWM’s, transforming them from deterministic and incoherent to probabilistic and standardized. The work aims to revolutionize SWM’s in two ways: (1) by quantifying uncertainty in Vs profiles derived from SWM’s such that suites of acceptable Vs profiles are provided with confidence-intervals on layer thickness and velocity — advancing from deterministic to probabilistic, and (2) developing standards for SWM’s applied to solving engineering problems — advancing from incoherent recommendations to coherent standards.\n\nCox’s team is in the process of analyzing the surface wave datasets collected at GVDA. Then, the suites of Vs profiles they develop will be used to perform site response analyses. “Our site response analyses, which contain realistic estimates of epistemic uncertainty and aleatory variability in Vs, will be compared with the recorded site response, which is currently poorly predicted using standard 1D site-response methods and existing borehole Vs profiles,” he says.\n\nCox’s work emphasizes the importance of accurate shear wave velocity profiles in earthquake hazard studies. All methods used to measure Vs (both invasive/borehole methods and non-invasive/surface wave methods) contain uncertainty. It should no longer be acceptable for Vs profiles to be reported without accompanying estimates of uncertainty. Otherwise, subsequent analyses will be performed with assumed estimates of uncertainty, which are often not accurate. \n\nWithout meaningful estimates of epistemic uncertainty and aleatory variability, a Vs profile used for seismic site response is often varied by +/- 20-30 percent in an attempt to account for these uncertainties. While performed with the goal of being conservative, this approach may actually be unconservative, as the problem is one of predicting resonances at the site, which may be diluted by such a wide range of input profiles that do not meaningfully represent site conditions.  \n\nThe dataset will be available from the DesignSafe repository in the very near future.\n\n \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBrady Cox\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAssociate Professor of Civil Engineering\n\t\t\tUniversity of Texas, Austin\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\nNHERI Quarterly\n\nSpring 2017\n\n\nNHERI@UTexas Microtremor Stations: Revolutionary Work in Garner Valley\n\nHigh-Achieving Wind Researcher Elawady Joins FIU\n\nPurdue Research Aims to Accelerate Disaster Reconnaissance Data Use\n\nUniversity of Florida Terraformer on Science Nation\n\nREU Program in Full Swing\n\nMeet the NHERI User Forum\n\nSpring 2017 NHERI Project Awardees\n\nUC Davis NSF Business Systems Review\n ","django_id":"803","title":"NHERI@UTexas Microtremor Stations","url":"https://designsafe-ci.org/community/news/2017/nheriutexas-microtremor-stations","text":"NHERI@UTexas Microtremor Stations:\nRevolutionary Work in Garner Valley\n\nPublished on April 7, 2017\n\n \n\nUniversity of Texas graduate students Andrew Stolte (left) and David Teague making surface wave measurements at the Garner Valley Downhole Array site.\n\n \n\nBrady Cox and his University of Texas, Austin, team are working to quantify uncertainty in shear wave velocity assessments.\n\nIn September of 2016, the group conducted field tests for Project CMMI-1261775, titled PECASE: Revolutionizing Surface Wave Methods for Engineering Analyses - from Deterministic and Incoherent to Probabilistic and Standardized (DIPS).\n\nBetween September 25th and 30th, both active-source and passive-wavefield surface wave measurements were conducted at the Garner Valley Downhole Array site in Southern California.

She joins the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Florida International University at the rank of an Assistant Professor. She received her B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees with distinction from Ain Shams University in Cairo, Egypt, in which she continued as a Demonstrator, a title granted only to distinguished graduates.\n\nHer excellent qualifications were immediately recognized by the leading international consultant firm Dar Group, where she worked as a structural engineer. Her passion for academic research drove her to pursue advanced graduate studies; Western University in Ontario, Canada, was a perfect match to her research interests.\n\nElawady received her PhD degree from Western University in 2016, with a focus on wind and structural engineering. Her PhD project focused on finding solutions to mitigate the replicated failures of transmission line structures during downburst events.\n\nDuring her PhD, Dr. Elawady worked closely with the ASCE-74 Committee, which develops guidelines for transmission line structures.

While it must be a widely accessible platform, a balanced approach\nto cybersecurity is required to support the confidentiality and integrity of the CI by architecting for\nsecurity best practices, employing risk-based methodologies, and establishing a common project-wide\napproach to meet the needs of all NHERI awardees.\n\nDesignSafe implements cybersecurity based upon TACC’s well-established approach that is compliant\nwith the federal standards in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) in NIST\nSpecial Publication 800-53 Revision 4. We implement authentication, authorization and accounting\n(AAA) based on TACC’s mature, proven system, and featuring Toopher multi-factor authentication.\nThe DesignSafe AAA will be federated with InCommon via TACC’s current affiliation, providing users\nsingle sign-on convenience. DesignSafe benefits from The Bro Network Security Monitor intrusion\ndetection system that is already implemented to protect all information systems in the TACCdatacenter.\nAs the NHERI-CI lead, we establish and implement the NHERI-wide cybersecurity policy and\nprocedure. The DesignSafeCybersecuritylead, TACC’sInformation Security OfficerMendoza, will:\n\n lead a Security Working Group comprised of members from eachNHERI awardee,andestablish\nincident response protocols including coordinating with the 24/7/365 operations center at TACC;\n develop cybersecurity policy and procedures for all awardees including baseline security\nguidelines/minimum requirements, user acceptable use policy, privileged user policy, network\nsecurity, data confidentiality and privacy;\n establish and perform risk/threat analysis with all NHERI awardees;\n adapt/modify TACC’s current cybersecurity audit process for use in the NHERI program,\nconduct an annual cybersecurity audit, and provide an audit report toCouncil and NSF;\n collaborate with cybersecurity teams of other major CI projects (iPlant, XSEDE, OSG, etc.)\nto ensure continued best practices are employed, and for awareness of incidents on those other\nCI projects that could impact DesignSafe;\n attend and participate in an annual NSF-supported Cybersecurity Summit, such as those\nprovided by the Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure of which TACC attends\nregularly.\n\nThe following is the DesignSafe Security Plan, as adapted from TACC’s Security Plan. This Security\nPlan forms the basis by which other NHERI sites will be audited and is the baseline security posture for\nNHERI Awardees. Successful implementation of the Cybersecurity Program will be measured by\ncompleting the security audits and by completing resolution of any audit results.\n1. Roles and Responsibilities\nWhile cybersecurity is the responsibility of all stakeholders, specific duties and responsibilities of\ncertain key individuals is made explicit here for the sake of clear accountability.\n1.1. DesignSafe Management Team\nUltimately, overall responsibility for the success of the DesignSafe CI lies with the management team\ncomprised of the DesignSafe PI/Project Director Ellen Rathje, co-PI’s Clint Dawson, Jamie Padgett, \nJean-Paul Pinelli, and Dan Stanzione, Deputy Project Director Tim Cockerill, Project Manager Natalie\nHenriques and Portal Lead Steve Mock. This management team will be assisted by the DesignSafe\nCSO in the matter of the cybersecurity program and its overall goals, objectives, and priorities in order\nto support the overall mission of DesignSafe. The senior management team is also responsible for\nensuring that adequate resources are applied to the security program to ensure its success.\n1.2. DesignSafe Chief Security Officer\nThe DesignSafe CSO Nathaniel Mendoza, also TACC’s Information Security Officer, directs\nDesignSafe’s day-to-day management of its security program, including maintaining a secure\nenvironment for the DesignSafe CI, providing security advice to the DesignSafe user community,\nconducting regular security audits, and coordinating all security related interactions among the various\nparticipating NHERI organizations as the leader of the Security Working Group.\n1.3. NHERI Awardees\nTo ensure that proper security measures are taken by each of the NHERI Awardees (each EF, NCO,\nSimCenter, and RAPID), local site security is ultimately the responsibility of each NHERI Awardee\nPrincipal Investigator. Each awardee will identify a main point of contact to participate in the NHERIwide\nSecurity Working Group, coordinate with the DesignSafe CSO for security audits, and be a\nmember of the incident response team.\n1.4. Security Working Group\nThe DesignSafe CSO is the leader of this working group, and members are the local site security\npoints of contact from each of the other NHERI awardees – one each from the seven EF’s, one from\nthe RAPID facility, one from the SimCenter, and one from the NCO. Communications will be\nmaintained via a monthly Zoom virtual meeting and via an email list. The annual security audits will\nbe done virtually as well.\n2. Administrative Safeguards\n2.1. Risk Assessment\n2.1.1.Risk Assessment Policy and Procedures\nDesignSafe’s risk assessment policy and procedures are developed, reviewed, updated and\ndisseminated by the DesignSafe CSO. This is done annually, or as needed if urgent security\ninformation becomes available and new resources are brought online in the information system. Risk\nassessment identifies threats to and vulnerabilities of DesignSafe’s information system.\n2.1.2.Risk Assessment\nDesignSafe risk assessment takes into account vulnerabilities, threat sources and security controls that\nare planned or in place to determine the resulting level of residual risk posed to DesignSafe’s\noperations, assets or individuals based on the operation of the information system. Risk assessments\nare conducted and results documented as threats are identified and addressed.\n2.2. Audit\nDesignSafe’s comprehensive cybersecurity approach includes a security audit at each of the NHERI\nAwardees performed once a year. The audits use security best practices to verify that each server-class\nsystem operating at a NHERI Awardee site is operating in a manner to limit the potential for security\nincidents and breaches. Security incidents and data breaches could invalidate data being collected by\nscientists, damage experimental equipment, and spread the damage to the DesignSafe resources. No\nsystem can be perfectly secure, but regular audits of the system provide vital information for the \nregular upkeep and secure maintenance of the server systems.\n2.2.1.Schedule for Audits\nEach NHERI Awardee together with the DesignSafe CSO will determine an appropriate time schedule\nfor performing the audit. This will be coordinated within 6 months after NSF awards are made with\neach NHERI Awardee. The audits will generally be done once a year, and will be performed virtually.\nHowever, in the event that a security incident occurs then further audits may be done. In all cases, the\ntiming for the audit will be decided in consultation with the NHERI Awardee, such that the site\noperations are minimally affected and the resources of the site IT staff are optimally utilized.\n2.2.2.Actions following the Audits\nIf there are audit findings, the DesignSafe CSO will recommend corrective actions for the NHERI\nAwardee to implement. A formal report will be generated once a year that summarizes the results of\nthe audits for each NHERI Awardee. The report will identify the assets that were a part of the audit,\nwhere the audit did find vulnerabilities and security breaches, and remediation actions, both short term\nand long term. This report will not be for public disclosure, keeping in view the security sensitive\nnature of the information, but will be made available to the NSF.\n3. Technical Safeguards\n3.1. Proactive Security Monitoring and Detection\nThe DesignSafe resources are protected within the TACC datacenter by a firewall and a Bro Intrusion\nDetection system that monitors 100% of the network traffic and can automatically block IP’s. Further\nautomated analysis and detection is accomplished by ingesting logs from all datacenter resources into\nTACC’s Splunk Operational Intelligence system. TACC’s 24/7/365 Operations staff receive\nnotifications from these monitoring systems and can take corrective action and notify the CSO which\ninitiates the formal incident response. Additionally, users can report an incident via the DesignSafe\nHelp system that will also notify TACC’s Operations staff.\nAll connection to the DesignSafe CI, for example from EF site servers, must be encrypted and all data\ntransport is encrypted e.g. using SSH, HTTPS, etc.\n3.2. Vulnerability Scanning\nDesignSafe uses appropriate vulnerability scanning tools and techniques, scanning for vulnerabilities\nin the information system weekly using a third-party software tool and ad-hoc as needed such as after\nmajor systems changes or when significant new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system are\nidentified and reported.\n4. Administrative Safeguards\n4.1. Authentication and Authorization\nDesignSafe’s plan for Authentication and Authorization is utilizes TACC’s well-established and\nproven infrastructure for a secure CI environment.\n4.2. Access Control\nIdentification, authentication, and authorization are controls that facilitate access to and protect\nDesignSafe resources and data. Access to non-public resources will be achieved by unique user\ncredentials and will require authentication.\nDesignSafe will assign a username and password for identification and authentication purposes to each\nindividual that has a need to access DesignSafe resources. In all cases, only the minimum privileges \nnecessary to complete required tasks are assigned to that individual. Privileges assigned to each\nindividual will be reviewed on a periodic basis and modified or revoked upon a change in status within\nthe DesignSafe community. All DesignSafe resources must use only encrypted authentication and\nauthorization mechanisms unless otherwise authorized by the CSO.\n5. Policy and Procedures\n5.1. Creating User Accounts\nDesignSafe user accounts will be created as TACC user accounts, and users will be required to provide\nidentification information that enables TACC user services personnel to ensure we are compliant with\nUniversity of Texas, state, and federal laws and regulations per standard TACC user policies. We will\nalso federate account creation with InCommon, such that users can link their InCommon identity with a\nTACC identity and use their local institution credentials.\n5.2. User Credentials\nDesignSafe will initially use single-factor authentication via a user password. Multi-factor authentication\nis being phased into TACC’s authentication infrastructure, and if deemed necessary will be applied to the\nDesignSafe CI. For multi-factor authentication, users would have a password and in addition a second\nmechanism of a short-lived access code provided by a fob or via mobile device app. The use of group\naccounts for administrative purposes and shared passwords for those accounts will be minimized where\ntechnically feasible. DesignSafe staff requiring privileged user access will be using RSASecurID fobs for\ncontrolling root access to resources.\nCredentials may be used only by the authorized user. Passwords or accounts should never be shared with\nanyone. Account owners will be held responsible for any actions performed using their accounts.\nDesignSafe staff will never ask users to disclose their passwords in any manner. Passwords should never\nbe written down and left in plain sight, or stored in plain text online.\n5.3. Inactive Account Expiration\nDesignSafe accounts that are inactive for 120 days will be deactivated, and the user will need to\nrequest reactivation of the account.\n6. Physical Safeguards\n6.1. Physical Access Authorization\nDesignSafe controls physical access points (including designated entry/exit points) to facilities\ncontaining information systems (except for those areas within the facilities officially designated\nas publicly accessible) and to verify individual access authorizations before granting access to the\nfacilities. Senior management decides who is authorized to enter controlled areas, and the CISO\nor designated personnel are responsible for enabling access.\n6.2. Access Control for Transmission Medium\nAdequate physical protection is in place for wiring closets and communication demark areas to\nprevent accidental damage, disruption, or intentional physical tampering of transmission lines.\n7. Awareness and Training\nAwareness of the DesignSafe Cybersecurity Plan for NHERI Awardees will be achieved via the\nSecurity Working Group, and assurance of awareness and compliance is achieved via the \naforementioned audits.\nNHERI Awardees shall adhere to their local University cybersecurity policies, and participate in their\nlocal University cybersecurity awareness and training.\nTACC follows the UT-Austin security awareness and training policy. Upon hiring, all UT-Austin staff\nare required to complete designated modules in the UT-Austin Compliance Training System\nwww.utexas.edu/hr/hrpro/comply/training.html based on job function, including CW 170 IT\nSecurity Awareness. Staff members are required to perform this testing every two (2) years. The\nCompliance Training System maintains a log of completed training and automatically notifies a staff\nmember when retraining is required. All training modules are developed and facilitated by UT-Austin's\nUniversity Compliance Services (UCS).\n8. Incident Response and Notification Procedures\nUpon notification of a possible security incident, the DesignSafe CSO will lead a formal incident\nresponse. The DesignSafe Security Working Group will be informed that a response is being initiated,\nand the response team will be formed based upon the extent of the incident. It will be necessary to\nquickly suspend the suspected user account(s), services, or systems to prevent an escalation of the\nincident. The team will analyze all available information, interrogate any persons involved, determine\ncorrective measures, and assure corrections are implemented and effective prior to allowing any\naccounts, services or systems to be brought back online. An incident report will be generated and shared\nwith the Security Working Group. Relevant information from the report will be shared with the\nDesignSafe Management Team and NSF as appropriate.

While it must be a widely accessible platform, a balanced approach\nto cybersecurity is required to support the confidentiality and integrity of the CI by architecting for\nsecurity best practices, employing risk-based methodologies, and establishing a common project-wide\napproach to meet the needs of all NHERI awardees.\n\nDesignSafe implements cybersecurity based upon TACC’s well-established approach that is compliant\nwith the federal standards in the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) in NIST\nSpecial Publication 800-53 Revision 4. We implement authentication, authorization and accounting\n(AAA) based on TACC’s mature, proven system, and featuring Toopher multi-factor authentication.\nThe DesignSafe AAA will be federated with InCommon via TACC’s current affiliation, providing users\nsingle sign-on convenience. DesignSafe benefits from The Bro Network Security Monitor intrusion\ndetection system that is already implemented to protect all information systems in the TACCdatacenter.\nAs the NHERI-CI lead, we establish and implement the NHERI-wide cybersecurity policy and\nprocedure. The DesignSafeCybersecuritylead, TACC’sInformation Security OfficerMendoza, will:\n\n lead a Security Working Group comprised of members from eachNHERI awardee,andestablish\nincident response protocols including coordinating with the 24/7/365 operations center at TACC;\n develop cybersecurity policy and procedures for all awardees including baseline security\nguidelines/minimum requirements, user acceptable use policy, privileged user policy, network\nsecurity, data confidentiality and privacy;\n establish and perform risk/threat analysis with all NHERI awardees;\n adapt/modify TACC’s current cybersecurity audit process for use in the NHERI program,\nconduct an annual cybersecurity audit, and provide an audit report toCouncil and NSF;\n collaborate with cybersecurity teams of other major CI projects (iPlant, XSEDE, OSG, etc.)\nto ensure continued best practices are employed, and for awareness of incidents on those other\nCI projects that could impact DesignSafe;\n attend and participate in an annual NSF-supported Cybersecurity Summit, such as those\nprovided by the Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure of which TACC attends\nregularly.\n\nThe following is the DesignSafe Security Plan, as adapted from TACC’s Security Plan. This Security\nPlan forms the basis by which other NHERI sites will be audited and is the baseline security posture for\nNHERI Awardees. Successful implementation of the Cybersecurity Program will be measured by\ncompleting the security audits and by completing resolution of any audit results.\n1. Roles and Responsibilities\nWhile cybersecurity is the responsibility of all stakeholders, specific duties and responsibilities of\ncertain key individuals is made explicit here for the sake of clear accountability.\n1.1. DesignSafe Management Team\nUltimately, overall responsibility for the success of the DesignSafe CI lies with the management team\ncomprised of the DesignSafe PI/Project Director Ellen Rathje, co-PI’s Clint Dawson, Jamie Padgett, \nJean-Paul Pinelli, and Dan Stanzione, Deputy Project Director Tim Cockerill, Project Manager Natalie\nHenriques and Portal Lead Steve Mock. This management team will be assisted by the DesignSafe\nCSO in the matter of the cybersecurity program and its overall goals, objectives, and priorities in order\nto support the overall mission of DesignSafe. The senior management team is also responsible for\nensuring that adequate resources are applied to the security program to ensure its success.\n1.2. DesignSafe Chief Security Officer\nThe DesignSafe CSO Nathaniel Mendoza, also TACC’s Information Security Officer, directs\nDesignSafe’s day-to-day management of its security program, including maintaining a secure\nenvironment for the DesignSafe CI, providing security advice to the DesignSafe user community,\nconducting regular security audits, and coordinating all security related interactions among the various\nparticipating NHERI organizations as the leader of the Security Working Group.\n1.3. NHERI Awardees\nTo ensure that proper security measures are taken by each of the NHERI Awardees (each EF, NCO,\nSimCenter, and RAPID), local site security is ultimately the responsibility of each NHERI Awardee\nPrincipal Investigator. Each awardee will identify a main point of contact to participate in the NHERIwide\nSecurity Working Group, coordinate with the DesignSafe CSO for security audits, and be a\nmember of the incident response team.\n1.4. Security Working Group\nThe DesignSafe CSO is the leader of this working group, and members are the local site security\npoints of contact from each of the other NHERI awardees – one each from the seven EF’s, one from\nthe RAPID facility, one from the SimCenter, and one from the NCO.

The results of the project will engage the cladding on a building to enhance a structure's resilience to multiple hazards. \nThe focus of this project is to develop computational simulation of a prototype semi-active damping device, installed between the cladding and structural frame, to the varying loading frequencies and intensities from multiple hazards. The objective of the system is twofold: (1) to engage the cladding as a mass damper to mitigate inter-story drift due to lateral load vibrations; and (2) to utilize the device as an energy dissipator under lateral loads. An innovative semi-active device with decentralized control laws will be developed to satisfy the varying energy dissipation and control objectives associated with each hazard. The research team will perform advanced nonlinear numerical simulations of realistic buildings with semi-active damping devices to assess the various parameters that influence the control laws and performance of the devices. The simulations will be validated through large-scale experiments in the laboratory.

Buildings in this height range are commonly built using concrete or steel. A recent new timber structural innovation, known as cross laminated timber (CLT), was developed in western Europe and is now being implemented around the world as a sustainable and low carbon-footprint alternative to conventional structural materials for tall buildings. However, an accepted and validated design method for tall CLT buildings to resist earthquakes has not yet been developed, and therefore construction of these tall wood buildings in the United States has been limited. This research will break this barrier by investigating a seismic design methodology for resilient tall wood buildings that can be immediately re-occupied following a design level earthquake and quickly repaired (compared to current building systems) after a large earthquake. Using the seismic design methodology developed in this project, the research team will work with practitioners across the engineering and architectural communities to design, build, and validate the performance of CLT wooden buildings by conducting full-scale sub-assembly system testing at the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) experimental facility at Lehigh University. This research will enable a new sustainable construction practice that is cost-competitive, thereby increasing demands for engineered wood production, providing added value for forest resources, and enhancing job growth in the construction and forestry sectors.\nA series of full-scale bi-directional testing of building sub-assembly systems will be performed to investigate the performance of CLT rocking walls under simulated seismic loading conditions. The structural systems investigated will include post-tensioned CLT rocking walls. Implementing segmental rocking walls in a full building system will be a transformative concept that has yet to be realized physically. The rocking wall systems will be investigated under the context of holistic building behavior, including gravity systems and non-structural components. The test will enable the design methodology developed in this research to be experimentally validated, and will at the same time generate a landmark data set for tall wood buildings under dynamic loading that will be available to the broader research and practitioner community through the NHERI DesignSafe-ci.org Data Depot. The project will facilitate implementation of this new structural archetype by interfacing closely with practitioners in the Pacific Northwest interested in tall CLT buildings as a cost-competitive design option. Graduate and undergraduate students, including community college students, will actively participate in this research and gain valuable knowledge and experience, which will prepare them to become leaders in sustainable building practices using modern engineered wood materials.\n\nCollaborative Research: A Resilience-based Seismic Design Methodology for Tall Wood Buildings – Non-structural Component Studies\nCMMI 1635363 – PI Keri Ryan, University of Nevada\nCMMI 1634628 – PI John van de Lindt, Colorado State University\nCMMI 1634204 – PI Jeffrey Berman, University of Washington\nAs the U.S. population continues to grow in urban communities, the demand for tall residential and mixed-use buildings in the range of eight to twenty stories continues to increase.

The results of the project will engage the cladding on a building to enhance a structure's resilience to multiple hazards. \nThe focus of this project is to develop computational simulation of a prototype semi-active damping device, installed between the cladding and structural frame, to the varying loading frequencies and intensities from multiple hazards. The objective of the system is twofold: (1) to engage the cladding as a mass damper to mitigate inter-story drift due to lateral load vibrations; and (2) to utilize the device as an energy dissipator under lateral loads. An innovative semi-active device with decentralized control laws will be developed to satisfy the varying energy dissipation and control objectives associated with each hazard. The research team will perform advanced nonlinear numerical simulations of realistic buildings with semi-active damping devices to assess the various parameters that influence the control laws and performance of the devices. The simulations will be validated through large-scale experiments in the laboratory. The experiments will include real-time hybrid simulations for wind and seismic loading that account for the complete building system and its interactions with the semi-active damping devices and cladding. Air-blast shock tube tests will be conducted to simulate blast loading. Performance-based design procedures will be established to integrate the design of semi-active cladding within a holistic structural design approach.\n\nCollaborative Research: A Resilience-based Seismic Design Methodology for Tall Wood Buildings – Structural Component Studies\nCMMI 1635227 – PI James Ricles, Lehigh University; co-PI Richard Sause, Lehigh UniversityCMMI 1636164 – PI Shiling Pei, Colorado School of Mines\nCMMI 1635156 – PI James Dolan, Washington State University\nAs the U.S. population continues to grow in urban communities, the demand for tall residential and mixed-use buildings in the range of eight to twenty stories continues to increase. Buildings in this height range are commonly built using concrete or steel. A recent new timber structural innovation, known as cross laminated timber (CLT), was developed in western Europe and is now being implemented around the world as a sustainable and low carbon-footprint alternative to conventional structural materials for tall buildings. However, an accepted and validated design method for tall CLT buildings to resist earthquakes has not yet been developed, and therefore construction of these tall wood buildings in the United States has been limited. This research will break this barrier by investigating a seismic design methodology for resilient tall wood buildings that can be immediately re-occupied following a design level earthquake and quickly repaired (compared to current building systems) after a large earthquake. Using the seismic design methodology developed in this project, the research team will work with practitioners across the engineering and architectural communities to design, build, and validate the performance of CLT wooden buildings by conducting full-scale sub-assembly system testing at the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) experimental facility at Lehigh University. This research will enable a new sustainable construction practice that is cost-competitive, thereby increasing demands for engineered wood production, providing added value for forest resources, and enhancing job growth in the construction and forestry sectors.\nA series of full-scale bi-directional testing of building sub-assembly systems will be performed to investigate the performance of CLT rocking walls under simulated seismic loading conditions. The structural systems investigated will include post-tensioned CLT rocking walls. Implementing segmental rocking walls in a full building system will be a transformative concept that has yet to be realized physically. The rocking wall systems will be investigated under the context of holistic building behavior, including gravity systems and non-structural components. The test will enable the design methodology developed in this research to be experimentally validated, and will at the same time generate a landmark data set for tall wood buildings under dynamic loading that will be available to the broader research and practitioner community through the NHERI DesignSafe-ci.org Data Depot. The project will facilitate implementation of this new structural archetype by interfacing closely with practitioners in the Pacific Northwest interested in tall CLT buildings as a cost-competitive design option. Graduate and undergraduate students, including community college students, will actively participate in this research and gain valuable knowledge and experience, which will prepare them to become leaders in sustainable building practices using modern engineered wood materials.\n\nCollaborative Research: A Resilience-based Seismic Design Methodology for Tall Wood Buildings – Non-structural Component Studies\nCMMI 1635363 – PI Keri Ryan, University of Nevada\nCMMI 1634628 – PI John van de Lindt, Colorado State University\nCMMI 1634204 – PI Jeffrey Berman, University of Washington\nAs the U.S. population continues to grow in urban communities, the demand for tall residential and mixed-use buildings in the range of eight to twenty stories continues to increase.

It will incorporate a wide range of natural hazards, utilizing both measured data and results from numerical simulations, and it will include systems ranging from individual components and structures to communities comprising multiple structures and lifeline networks.\n\nThe SimCenter is composed of:\n\n\n\tA computational framework that supports decision-making and enhances community resilience to natural hazards\n\tA framework that weaves together existing simulation tools and data, so it can be employed in the near-term and improve as users identify new needs\n\tA sufficiently flexible, extensible, and scalable framework where any component can be enhanced to improve simulations and thereby meet future needs\n\tAn ecosystem that fosters collaboration between scientists, engineers, urban planners, public officials, and others who seek to improve community resilience to natural hazards\n\n\nSimCenter Team\n\nPrincipal Investigator\n\n\n\n\n\nSteve Mahin\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n\n\nLeadership Team\n\n\n\n\n\nCamille Crittenden\n\nCITRIS and the Banatao Institute, UC Berkeley\n\n\n\n\n\nGreg Deierlein\n\nStanford University\n\n\n\n\n\nSanjay Govindjee\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n\n\n\n\nAhsan Kareem\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Lowes\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nManagement Team\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank McKenna\n\nChief Technology Officer\n\n\n\n\n\nMatthew Schoettler\n\nAssociate Director for Operations\n\n ","slug":"about-new","django_ct":"cms.page","page_id":null,"id":"cms.page.1085"}}

According to field survey reports from recent tsunamis, many residents in mainland areas that are shadowed by islands believe that the islands protect them from tsunamis. At Oregon State University (OSU), researchers are working to determine just how true or untrue the idea is.\n\nWorking with the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI), OSU is conducting research at its O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory. Using the facility’s wave generating pool, researchers are simulating the effects of tsunamis on conical islands.\n\nPedro Lomonaco, civil and construction engineering director at the O.H. Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory, stressed the importance of understanding just how safe a region is in the event of a tsunami.\n\n“If you live behind an island you typically think you are more protected from a tsunami,” Lomonaco said. “In some particular conditions that is not true. If you live behind them, sometime the impact of the (water) run-up is increased.”\n\nIn phase one of the research, islands of four different shapes were placed in the wave laboratory in order to test measure the run-up and hydrodynamics of a tsunami on the islands.\n\nThe impact of tsunamis is not the only thing being researched at OSU. According to Lomonaco, studies are also being conducted to better understand how to prevent elevated structures from being damaged by the run-up caused by storms.\n\nDamage to coastal structures caused by the result of combined surge and wave loading proved to be significant in recent events such as Hurricanes Ivan (2004), Katrina (2005), Ike (2008) and Sandy (2012). Elevated structures have become more commonplace as a result. Building stakeholders are seeking to limit damages and property loss.\n\nCurrently, no reliable mechanics equations exist to compute the combined force of surge and waves on these elevated structures. The goal of the elevated structure research is to understand the impact that surges and waves will have on them.\n\nBy testing the measure of force on structures on coastal lines Lomonaco hopes to increase the survival rate of structures occupying coastlines that are damaged by storm surges and wave loads.\n\n“We have a building that represents any type of structure on the coast and we test for certain conditions that create storm surge,” Lomonaco said. “When you have these storms, for example (Hurricane) Matthew, it increases water levels and waves can go inland. At this moment this is no systematic guidelines for how to asses these conditions for design purposes.”\n\nLomonaco hopes that the tests will lead to design guidelines that will decrease the damage caused by storm surges. By setting design guidelines future structures will be built in a way that minimizes the impact of storm surges.\n\nThe structures tested in the simulations were tested at different heights and elevations. The structures were also tested to see how they would hold up when coming in contact with debris during storm surges.\n\nAccording to Lomonaco the impact of the research will reach beyond just rather or not a structure survives the damage caused by a storm.\n\n“In the long run organizations like FEMA can have some guidelines and from there the people in structural design can make decisions to improve structures,” Lomonaco said. “The fragility curve will tell you the probability of certain level of damage in house. It will impact the design from day one. It will show you what houses are at more risk; effect home values and insurance costs. You may even find you need to retrofit your house or change the elevation.”\n\nLomonaco expects the research to make a difference sooner rather than later on coastal communities across the world.\n\n“It’s going to change the way houses are built and how to manage the coastal zone,” Lomonaco said. “My feeling is that it is going to have a huge impact relatively soon.

This research work presents results of a full-scale experimental study conducted under more realistic wind loading with the panels installed as they would be in the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E1592 test chamber. The research objectives were to (i) measure the uplift roof pressure experience by mono-sloped standing seam metal roofs and compare them with the provisions of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 7–10 standard, (ii) evaluate the performance of standing seam roofs under high winds, and (iii) compare the deflections and failure modes observed under more realistic wind loading to uniform loading tests. The research has provided test based data on aerodynamic loading of two types of standing seam metal roofs (i.e. vertical-leg and trapezoidal), as well as their performances under high wind speeds.\n\nLearn more about this project.\n\n\n\n\nWIND-INDUCED VIBRATION OF FULL-SCALE PV SYSTEMS\n\n\n\n\n\nTo address wind induced vibrations of PV systems, a multi-scale wind load measurement study was conducted at Florida International University (FIU) using a single PV system located on the roof of a building model. The PV panel orientation was adjusted to different tilt angles that would generally encompass common residential installations in North America. The goal of the study was to compare the net aerodynamic forces acting on an individual roof-mounted PV panel measured at full scale using the 6-fan Wall of Wind (WOW) hurricane simulator at FIU with those measured in a boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) of RWDI USA LLC at a scale of 1:12. A complementary full-scale and scaled model testing approach, such as the one discussed in this paper, may draw upon the strengths of each test method. Full-scale testing affords engineers with opportunities to (1) investigate possible Reynolds Number (Re) effects to assess the applicability of experimental results to the real design cases, (2) determine load transfer information on actual PV support systems, (3) study wind induced vibrations of PV systems when subjected to severe winds, and (4) evaluate possible failure modes due to high winds. Conversely, small-scale testing in the BLWT is an established and reputable method for wind load estimations accepted by most code-writing authorities, and provides a convenient platform for testing many different model configurations and wind directions in shorter amounts of time and at significantly lower costs when compared to equivalent full-scale testing. As a result of a comparison between full- and small-scale test results, the main observation was that the dynamic effects were one of the main sources of discrepancy between wind tunnel and WOW measurements. A post-test analytical approach was used to incorporate the dynamic effects to correct the measurements obtained on rigid model tested in wind tunnel to bring them in line with full scale results.\n\n\n\n\nAERODYNAMIC MITIGATION AND POWER SYSTEM (AMPS) – Patented: US 2015/0345472 A1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe roof is the most vulnerable part of a low rise building as it is often affected in the event of high winds that produce high suctions or uplift forces on the edges and corners. This study investigates the application of an active mitigation strategy, in the form of an Active Aerodynamics Mitigation and Power Production System (AMPS) (United States Patent Application Publication, Pub. No.: US 2015/0345472 A1, Pub. Date: Dec. 3, 2015), designed to simultaneously reduce wind damage and provide power to buildings, homes, and other infrastructures. The system consists of horizontal axis wind turbines attached to the roof edges with or without gutters. Three different configurations of this system were tested on a flat roof of a low rise building model for a range of wind directions through experiments at the Wall of Wind Experimental Facility (WOW EF) at Florida International University (FIU), USA. In one of the configurations, the wind turbines were placed slightly above the roof edge, while in the other two configurations, the turbines were placed closer to the roof edge. Estimation of area averaged mean and peak pressure coefficients were made for various locations on the roof for the three different configurations, and compared with the case of no mitigation (i.e. bare roof deck without AMPS). Results show that for all wind directions tested, significant reduction in mean and peak pressure coefficients (reduced suction) were obtained in those cases where the wind turbines were placed closer to the roof edge as compared to the bare roof deck case. Flow visualization studies showed that the turbines helped to disrupt the conical vortices caused by cornering winds, thereby reducing the wind uplift forces on the roof. This study shows that the active mitigation system can be utilised to prevent wind induced damage to the roof while generating wind energy. Future research is underway to study the effectiveness of AMPS in mitigating wind loading on other kinds of buildings and structures.\n\nLearn more about this project.\n\n\n\n\nLARGE-SCALE TESTING ON WIND UPLIFT OF ROOF PAVERS\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study presents a large-scale experimental study to investigate the wind loading on concrete roof pavers on the flat roof of a low rise building. The experiments were performed in Wall of Wind, a largescale hurricane testing facility at Florida International University. Experiments included both wind blowoff tests and pressure measurements on the top and bottom surfaces of the pavers. The effects of the pavers' edge-gap to spacer height ratio and the relative parapet height on the wind performance of roof pavers were also investigated. The results showed that increasing the edge-gap to spacer height ratio parameter decreases the net pressures by enhancing pressure equalization between top and bottom surfaces. Also, increasing the relative parapet height reduces the worst suctions for the parapet heights considered in this study. The resolution of the pressure taps was found to have significant influence on the test results. Too few taps can result in underestimation of the net uplift and overturning moments that can cause failure under strong winds. Guidelines on the resolution and location of pressure taps were provided for better capturing the effects of conical vortices on wind loads on pavers. Results of the wind blow-off tests are compared with those obtained from pressure measurements and a typical practice based on ASCE 7-10 exterior pressures.\n\nLearn more about this project.\n\n\n\n\nREYNOLDS NUMBER EFFECTS ON TWIN BOX GIRDER LONG SPAN BRIDGE AERODYNAMICS\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work investigates the effects of Reynolds number (Re) on the aerodynamic characteristics of a twin-deck bridge. A 1:36 scale sectional model of a twin girder bridge was tested using the Wall of Wind (WOW) open jet wind tunnel facility at Florida International University (FIU). Static tests were performed on the model, instrumented with pressure taps and load cells, at high wind speeds with Re ranging from 1.3 × 106 to 6.1 × 106 based on the section width. Results show that the section was almost insensitive to Re when pitched to negative angles of attack. However, mean and fluctuating pressure distributions changed noticeably for zero and positive wind angles of attack while testing at different Re regimes. The pressure results suggested that with the Re increase, a larger separation bubble formed on the bottom surface of the upstream girder accompanied with a narrower wake region. As a result, drag coefficient decreased mildly and negative lift coefficient increased. Flow modification due to the Re increase also helped in distributing forces more equally between the two girders. The bare deck section was found to be prone to vortex shedding with limited dependence on the Re. Based on the observations, vortex mitigation devices attached to the bottom surface were effective in inhibiting vortex shedding, particularly at lower Re regime.\n\nLearn more about this project.\n\n\nWorking With Us: Projects\n\nOngoing NSF Funded Projects\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNSF Grant Number\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPI Name (Institution)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProject Title\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1727401 (CMMI)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tChris Letchford (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tModel to Full-Scale Validation of Peak Pressure Mechanisms in Buildings that Cause Cladding Failures and Windstorm Damage\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1635569 (CMMI)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAbdollah Shafieezadeh (Ohio State University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tExperimentally Validated Stochastic Numerical Framework to Generate Multi-Dimensional Fragilities for Hurricane Resilience Enhancement of Transmission Systems\n\n\t\t\tSummary: This research will produce a state-of-the-art experimentally validated stochastic numerical framework to generate multi-dimensional fragility models for hurricane resilience enhancement of transmission systems. The research will involve a series of aeroelastic wind tunnel studies on the wind response of multispan transmission systems at the NHERI Wall of Wind EF at FIU. These novel sets of experimental data, together with high-fidelity three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of tower-conductor-insulator foundation systems, will provide new and critical insights into various complex wind-induced behaviors of these systems. The WOW tests will also enable characterization of dynamic boundary effects from neighboring spans.

To perform multi-physics simulation of multiple discrete objects in unstructured construction sites, an impulse-based discrete element method will be conceptualized. Component-based vulnerability and impact analysis with 3D Building or Civil Information Models (BIM/CIMs) will then be conducted to generate fundamental and highly specific knowledge on wind-induced damage mechanisms. Finally, the entire system will be validated in real-world construction projects and within a 12-fan NHERI Wall of Wind facility that can generate up to hurricane category 5 wind speeds.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1455709 (CMMI)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGuirong (Grace) Yan (Missouri University of Science and Technology)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDamage and Instability Detection of Civil Large-scale Space Structures under Operational and Multi-hazard Environments based on Change in Macro-geometrical Patterns/Shapes\n\n\t\t\tSummary: The ultimate goal of this study is to detect instability or damage of civil large-scale space structures under multi-hazard Environments to prevent structures from collapsing. In order to validate a two-way wind-structure interaction CFD model used in this study and to reveal the dynamic responses of a dome structure under extreme winds, a 1:50 scaled model of a dome structure will be tested at the NHERI WOW EF. The model structure will be equipped with more than 300 pressure taps to measure surface static pressures and the wind load experienced by the structure. This experiment provides, for the first time, an opportunity to test a very large scale dome structure under hurricane level winds.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1638336 (CRISP-Collaborative)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLandolf Rhode (University of Miami)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tA Human-Centered Computational Framework for Urban and Community Design of Resilient Coastal Cities\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1443999 (EARS)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKemal Akkaya (Florida International University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPervasive Spectrum Sharing for Public Safety Communications\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1151003 (Career)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tArindam Chowdhury (Florida International University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFull-Scale Simulation of Peak Responses to Reduce Hurricane Damage to Low Buildings and Use of Related Research to Develop Hurricane-Engineering Expertise\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1234004 (Collaborative)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSteve Cai (Louisiana State University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProgressive Failure Studies of Residential Houses towards Performance Based Hurricane Engineering\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1541142 (I-Corps)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tArindam Chowdhury (Florida International University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInnovative Hurricane Damage Mitigation Systems\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n ","django_id":"758","title":"Projects","url":"https://fiu.designsafe-ci.org/working-with-us/projects","text":" \n\nSelection of Wall of Wind Projects Demonstrating Capabilities &amp; Expertise\n\n\nTESTING THE WORLD'S FIRST VERTICAL FOREST\n\n\n\n\n\nWall of Wind researchers conducted full-scale testing of trees to determine realistic wind loads on various types of trees and the planter design to securely hold them in the balconies, which is impossible to do using small-scale models.\n\nLearn more about this project.\n\n\n\n\nRAIN INTRUSION STUDIES\n\n\n\n\n\nThis video compares the performance of two windows, one covered with a shutter (on the right) and the other one without a shutter (on the left), under wind-driven rain conditions simulated at the Wall of Wind.

Experiments included both wind blowoff tests and pressure measurements on the top and bottom surfaces of the pavers. The effects of the pavers' edge-gap to spacer height ratio and the relative parapet height on the wind performance of roof pavers were also investigated. The results showed that increasing the edge-gap to spacer height ratio parameter decreases the net pressures by enhancing pressure equalization between top and bottom surfaces. Also, increasing the relative parapet height reduces the worst suctions for the parapet heights considered in this study. The resolution of the pressure taps was found to have significant influence on the test results. Too few taps can result in underestimation of the net uplift and overturning moments that can cause failure under strong winds. Guidelines on the resolution and location of pressure taps were provided for better capturing the effects of conical vortices on wind loads on pavers. Results of the wind blow-off tests are compared with those obtained from pressure measurements and a typical practice based on ASCE 7-10 exterior pressures.\n\nLearn more about this project.\n\n\n\n\nREYNOLDS NUMBER EFFECTS ON TWIN BOX GIRDER LONG SPAN BRIDGE AERODYNAMICS\n\n\n\n\n\nThis work investigates the effects of Reynolds number (Re) on the aerodynamic characteristics of a twin-deck bridge. A 1:36 scale sectional model of a twin girder bridge was tested using the Wall of Wind (WOW) open jet wind tunnel facility at Florida International University (FIU). Static tests were performed on the model, instrumented with pressure taps and load cells, at high wind speeds with Re ranging from 1.3 × 106 to 6.1 × 106 based on the section width. Results show that the section was almost insensitive to Re when pitched to negative angles of attack. However, mean and fluctuating pressure distributions changed noticeably for zero and positive wind angles of attack while testing at different Re regimes. The pressure results suggested that with the Re increase, a larger separation bubble formed on the bottom surface of the upstream girder accompanied with a narrower wake region. As a result, drag coefficient decreased mildly and negative lift coefficient increased. Flow modification due to the Re increase also helped in distributing forces more equally between the two girders. The bare deck section was found to be prone to vortex shedding with limited dependence on the Re. Based on the observations, vortex mitigation devices attached to the bottom surface were effective in inhibiting vortex shedding, particularly at lower Re regime.\n\nLearn more about this project.\n\n\nWorking With Us: Projects\n\nOngoing NSF Funded Projects\n\n \n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNSF Grant Number\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPI Name (Institution)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProject Title\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1727401 (CMMI)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tChris Letchford (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tModel to Full-Scale Validation of Peak Pressure Mechanisms in Buildings that Cause Cladding Failures and Windstorm Damage\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1635569 (CMMI)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAbdollah Shafieezadeh (Ohio State University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tExperimentally Validated Stochastic Numerical Framework to Generate Multi-Dimensional Fragilities for Hurricane Resilience Enhancement of Transmission Systems\n\n\t\t\tSummary: This research will produce a state-of-the-art experimentally validated stochastic numerical framework to generate multi-dimensional fragility models for hurricane resilience enhancement of transmission systems. The research will involve a series of aeroelastic wind tunnel studies on the wind response of multispan transmission systems at the NHERI Wall of Wind EF at FIU. These novel sets of experimental data, together with high-fidelity three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of tower-conductor-insulator foundation systems, will provide new and critical insights into various complex wind-induced behaviors of these systems. The WOW tests will also enable characterization of dynamic boundary effects from neighboring spans. The multi-dimensional fragility surfaces, based on validated numerical models, will provide component and system-level structural and functional failure probabilities for units of transmission tower-lines.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1635378 (CMMI)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYoungjib Ham (Florida International University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tUncovering Potential Risks of Wind-induced Cascading Damages to Construction Projects and Neighboring Communities\n\n\t\t\tSummary: Using knowledge on potential at-risk construction resources obtained through experimental testing of extreme wind events, this project will partially or fully automatically model the current state of construction sites through machine vision techniques using multimodal visual data obtained from construction workers and camera-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles. To perform multi-physics simulation of multiple discrete objects in unstructured construction sites, an impulse-based discrete element method will be conceptualized. Component-based vulnerability and impact analysis with 3D Building or Civil Information Models (BIM/CIMs) will then be conducted to generate fundamental and highly specific knowledge on wind-induced damage mechanisms. Finally, the entire system will be validated in real-world construction projects and within a 12-fan NHERI Wall of Wind facility that can generate up to hurricane category 5 wind speeds.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1455709 (CMMI)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGuirong (Grace) Yan (Missouri University of Science and Technology)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDamage and Instability Detection of Civil Large-scale Space Structures under Operational and Multi-hazard Environments based on Change in Macro-geometrical Patterns/Shapes\n\n\t\t\tSummary: The ultimate goal of this study is to detect instability or damage of civil large-scale space structures under multi-hazard Environments to prevent structures from collapsing. In order to validate a two-way wind-structure interaction CFD model used in this study and to reveal the dynamic responses of a dome structure under extreme winds, a 1:50 scaled model of a dome structure will be tested at the NHERI WOW EF. The model structure will be equipped with more than 300 pressure taps to measure surface static pressures and the wind load experienced by the structure. This experiment provides, for the first time, an opportunity to test a very large scale dome structure under hurricane level winds.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1638336 (CRISP-Collaborative)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLandolf Rhode (University of Miami)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tA Human-Centered Computational Framework for Urban and Community Design of Resilient Coastal Cities\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1443999 (EARS)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKemal Akkaya (Florida International University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPervasive Spectrum Sharing for Public Safety Communications\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1151003 (Career)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tArindam Chowdhury (Florida International University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFull-Scale Simulation of Peak Responses to Reduce Hurricane Damage to Low Buildings and Use of Related Research to Develop Hurricane-Engineering Expertise\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1234004 (Collaborative)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSteve Cai (Louisiana State University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProgressive Failure Studies of Residential Houses towards Performance Based Hurricane Engineering\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t1541142 (I-Corps)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tArindam Chowdhury (Florida International University)\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInnovative Hurricane Damage Mitigation Systems\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n ","slug":"projects","django_ct":"cms.page","page_id":null,"id":"cms.page.758"}}

{"_index":"cms","_type":"modelresult","_id":"cms.page.920","_score":1,"_source":{"body":"Design Guidelines for Roof Pavers Against Wind Uplift\n\nResults from WOW Facility Research Expected to Improve Design Standards\n\nPublished on July 31, 2017\n\n \n\nMaryam Asghari Mooneghi installing roof pavers for large scale wind testing at the Wall of Wind facility, Florida International University.\n\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Canadian researchers R.J. Kind and R.L. Wardlaw performed pioneering wind-load research on roof pavers. That research provided the foundation for the paver criteria that is in the International Building Code (IBC).\n\nSubsequent experimental and numerical studies for investigating wind loading mechanisms on roof pavers have provided more insights on paver wind loads; however, that research has not been transformed into practice. Although pavers often provide adequate wind resistance, they can blow off roofs and pose safety threats.\n\n\nMaryam Asghari Mooneghi, PhD, Structural Analyst in Advanced Technology and Research Team, Arup, San Francisco\n\n \n\nTom Smith, AIA, RRC, F.SEI TLSmith Consulting Inc.\n\n\nTo address the problem, Maryam Asghari Mooneghi and her team at Florida International University conducted a series of studies to investigate the wind loading mechanism on air-permeable roofing systems including roof pavers. Investigations took place in 2013-14, as part of Mooneghi’s PhD research.\n\nThe project built upon previous research by conducting largescale experiments that were not possible prior to the existence of the Wall of Wind at FIU. The objective was to develop simple guidance, in code format, for design of loose-laid roof pavers against wind uplift. “Roof systems experience the most wind loading compared to any other building component,” Mooneghi says.\n\nMajor international codes and standards for wind loads in the U.S. and Canada (NBCC; ASCE 7) specify roof wind pressures for typical roof geometries, but there are no specific provisions on how to apply such pressures to roof pavers. “We conducted a series of studies to investigate the wind loading mechanism on roof pavers and developed simple design guidelines suitable for inclusion in codes and standards,” she says.\n\nExperimental Methods\n\nMooneghi and her team performed large-scale experiments to investigate the wind loading on concrete roof pavers on the flat roof of a low-rise building in the Wall of Wind facility at FIU.\n\n“The Wall of Wind facility at FIU can generate up to a Category 5 hurricane wind speed and is suitable for full-scale and large-scale destructive testing of roofing systems,” she explains.\n\nExperiments included wind blow-off tests and pressure measurements on the top and bottom surfaces of pavers. The basic test procedure consisted of first conducting wind blow-off tests. The aim was to provide guidance on the location where paver blow-off, i.e. failure, first occurs, which could then be used to decide on the pressure tap layout for detailed pressure measurements.\n\nDeveloping Design Guidelines\n\nBased on the experimental results, simplified guidelines were developed for design of loose-laid roof pavers against wind uplift and published in 2016 (“Towards guidelines for design of looselaid roof pavers for wind uplift,” Wind and Structures, Vol. 22, No. 2, 133-160).\n\nThe guidelines are formatted so that designers can make use of the existing information in codes and standards such as ASCE 7-10 standard’s pressure coefficients for components and cladding.

Kind and R.L. Wardlaw performed pioneering wind-load research on roof pavers. That research provided the foundation for the paver criteria that is in the International Building Code (IBC).\n\nSubsequent experimental and numerical studies for investigating wind loading mechanisms on roof pavers have provided more insights on paver wind loads; however, that research has not been transformed into practice. Although pavers often provide adequate wind resistance, they can blow off roofs and pose safety threats.\n\n\nMaryam Asghari Mooneghi, PhD, Structural Analyst in Advanced Technology and Research Team, Arup, San Francisco\n\n \n\nTom Smith, AIA, RRC, F.SEI TLSmith Consulting Inc.\n\n\nTo address the problem, Maryam Asghari Mooneghi and her team at Florida International University conducted a series of studies to investigate the wind loading mechanism on air-permeable roofing systems including roof pavers. Investigations took place in 2013-14, as part of Mooneghi’s PhD research.\n\nThe project built upon previous research by conducting largescale experiments that were not possible prior to the existence of the Wall of Wind at FIU. The objective was to develop simple guidance, in code format, for design of loose-laid roof pavers against wind uplift. “Roof systems experience the most wind loading compared to any other building component,” Mooneghi says.\n\nMajor international codes and standards for wind loads in the U.S. and Canada (NBCC; ASCE 7) specify roof wind pressures for typical roof geometries, but there are no specific provisions on how to apply such pressures to roof pavers. “We conducted a series of studies to investigate the wind loading mechanism on roof pavers and developed simple design guidelines suitable for inclusion in codes and standards,” she says.\n\nExperimental Methods\n\nMooneghi and her team performed large-scale experiments to investigate the wind loading on concrete roof pavers on the flat roof of a low-rise building in the Wall of Wind facility at FIU.\n\n“The Wall of Wind facility at FIU can generate up to a Category 5 hurricane wind speed and is suitable for full-scale and large-scale destructive testing of roofing systems,” she explains.\n\nExperiments included wind blow-off tests and pressure measurements on the top and bottom surfaces of pavers. The basic test procedure consisted of first conducting wind blow-off tests. The aim was to provide guidance on the location where paver blow-off, i.e. failure, first occurs, which could then be used to decide on the pressure tap layout for detailed pressure measurements.\n\nDeveloping Design Guidelines\n\nBased on the experimental results, simplified guidelines were developed for design of loose-laid roof pavers against wind uplift and published in 2016 (“Towards guidelines for design of looselaid roof pavers for wind uplift,” Wind and Structures, Vol. 22, No. 2, 133-160).\n\nThe guidelines are formatted so that designers can make use of the existing information in codes and standards such as ASCE 7-10 standard’s pressure coefficients for components and cladding. The effects of the pavers’ edge-gap to spacer height ratio and parapet height to building height ratio are included in the guidelines as adjustment factors.\n\nShortly after the design guidelines were published, they were put to use by Tom Smith, a roof consultant investigating a case in which pavers blew off a 25-story building. “The design criteria developed by Maryam and her team at FIU were vital for developing a solution to the blow-off problem.

On it, scientists and educators can find collections of post-earthquake reconnaissance data from reinforced concrete buildings — including thousands of photographs and videos — experiments on shear walls, RAPID data, bridge data, and more. DatacenterHub is maintained by Purdue University and is based on the HUBzero platform.\n\n \n\nWhat does it accomplish?\n\nDatacenterHub enables researchers to store and share valuable data for the hazard-research community and others. A number of hazard research databases were contributed to the NEEShub (the web interface that preceded DesignSafe-CI) which is no longer in service. Fortunately, NEES databases have been transferred to DatacenterHub to provide continued access. DatacenterHub holds a wealth of K-12 lesson plans and modules. It also holds experimental data that were initially located in the NEEShub “project warehouse.”\n\n \n\nHow does it work?\n\nAnyone may search DatacenterHub by clicking “Discover” on its main page and using the search boxes in the table that follows. Or, users may browse by resource type. All published data can be downloaded. To contribute data, users must first create an account. Accounts are free. Find details at .\n\n \n\nIs DatacenterHub suitable for longterm use?\n\nDatacenterHub is funded through 2021 (NSF grant #1724728), and plans are underway to make it available past that date. Purdue University and HUBzero are committed to long-term data preservation, as evidenced by efforts to keep these databases available. DatacenterHub also supports BagIt, a hierarchical file packaging format used by the Library of Congress for transfer, storage and preservation of digital content. With BagIt, it is possible to download entire datasets with the click of a button making it easy to archive and transfer any chosen dataset.\n\n \n\nQuestions?\n\nContact Santiago Pujol, Professor of Civil Engineering and Academic Director for Research Computing, Purdue University, spujol@purdue.edu.Related Links\n\n\nHUBzero: An Open-Source Scientific Platform\n\n ","slug":"datacenterhub-db-resource-researchers","django_ct":"cms.page","page_id":null,"id":"cms.page.1018"}}

Over the past 10 years, the HWRL received several major upgrades, including state-of the art instrumentation, a large-stroke piston-type wavemaker, and over 5,000 ft2 of new office and meeting space for staff and visiting researchers.\nThe NHERI Experimental Facility at Oregon State University, known as the NHERI Coastal Wave/Surge and Tsunami (NHERI CWST-EF), consist of two main resources to support a wide base of users:  the Large Wave Flume (LWF) and the Directional Wave Basin (DWB).  Both the flume and basin are capable of generating wind waves and tsunamis.  The flume is a two-dimensional representation of the coast (looking directly out to sea), eliminating the complexity of longshore currents and wave direction and allowing a cross-section of test specimens to be studied at a large scale.  The directional wave basin (DWB) increases the system complexity to three dimensions by extending laterally. In addition to these two resources, the Experimental Facility provides standard and state-of-the-art instrumentation to assess wave conditions, velocity, and response variables such as stress, strain, load and sediment transport (scour and erosion).\nThe CWST-EF at Oregon State University supports the overall vision of the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) program to increase the resilience of civil infrastructure and communities to coastal storms and tsunamis. Hurricanes and other coastal windstorms are extreme hazards with elevated surge and waves, high winds, and intense rains that threaten near-coast structures and critical lifelines such as bridges, roads, power and communication, and water supplies. Tsunamis can be triggered by seismic events, including fault displacement and landslides, and also represent extreme hazards with rapid inundation and damage. An additional challenge related to tsunami waves is the relative short time for advanced warning and evacuation strategies, not to mention the scarcity of tsunami events and unfeasibility to predict an earthquake.\nFACILITY OVERVIEW\n\n \n ","django_id":"73","title":"Facility Overview","url":"https://oregonstate.designsafe-ci.org/","text":"The O.H.

The algorithms to perform the different types of tests mentioned in the Science Plan reside on the RTMDxPC, which is a dedicated real-time xPC kernel. The algorithms were implemented by developing software that was cited above, and which will be discussed further below. All of the algorithms have been created in Simulink on the simulation coordinator (RTMDsim), and Simulink Real-Time from MathWorks, Inc. (Matlab 2014) is used to recreate real-time executable code that is subsequently loaded onto an RTMDxPC. If the experiment requires large computational models with many degrees-of-freedom to create the analytical substructure, then the executable code is parallelized and placed onto two RTMDxPCs such that multi-grid processing can be used to run a large experiment in real time (Chae et al. 2012). The Real-Time Integrated Control System uses SCRAMNet to enable communication among the telepresence server (RTMDtele), the simulation coordinator (RTMDsim), real-time target PC (RTMDxPC), the servo-hydraulic controllers (RTMDctrl), and data acquisition system (RTMDdaq). The data exchange across SCRAMNet occurs within 90 nanoseconds, essentially enabling shared memory among the workstations, thus enabling real-time testing capabilities. Synchronization is maintained through the use of a pulse trigger placed on SCRAMNet at the rate of 1024Hz. A data structure for SCRAMNet is in place that includes multiple states for commands and feedback signals, enabling advance servo-hydraulic control laws to be implemented to meet user needs and complex testing methods to be performed. Experiments can be run in real-time (e.g., real-time earthquake hybrid simulation, distributed real-time hybrid earthquake simulation, dynamic testing), or at an expanded time scale (e.g., hybrid simulation, distributed hybrid simulation, quasi-static testing). The Real-Time Integrated Control System is operated in distributed hybrid simulation mode using either UI-Simcor (Kwon et al. 2005), OpenFresco, or custom software. The System is robust and of a flexible design, enabling software and middleware packages developed by the NEHRI CI or users to be plugged into the System and utilized for conducting tests.\n\nThe integrated control system has a hydraulics-off simulation mode for use in validation of testing methods, training, and education. In the hydraulics-off simulation mode, the servo-hydraulic equipment (e.g., actuators, servo-valves) and test structure are analytically modeled. Models of the servo-hydraulic equipment have been developed in Simulink for this purpose, and have been calibrated based on system identification tests of the equipment (Zhang et al. 2005). To ensure the safety of personnel and equipment during a test, software limits are enabled on the RTMDxPC and RTMDctrl, hardware piston stroke limit switches are placed on the actuators, and an emergency stop system is activated throughout the laboratory.\n\nFor hybrid simulation, numerous options exist for creating the analytical substructure. The open-source program HybridFEM has been developed by Karavasilis et al. (2009) that enables analytical substructures to be created using embedded MATLAB functions in a Simulink model. The source code can be compiled and run in real-time to conduct real-time hybrid simulations. HybridFEM has an element library that includes nonlinear fiber elements, nonlinear panel zone elements, nonlinear hysteretic connection elements, nonlinear geometric elements based on the co-rotational formulation (to model the P-? effect), along with a material library that enables the hysteretic stress-strain behavior of steel, concrete, and reinforcement to be modeled. User-defined elements can be readily added to HybidFEM. HybridFEM has been successfully used on numerous projects by users to conduct a variety of types of experiments, including real-time hybrid simulations of structural systems (Mercan et al. 2008, Chen et al. 2009, Karavasilis et al. 2011a, Chen and Ricles 2011a,b, Chen et al. 2012, Chae et al. 2013a, 2014, Cha et al. 2013, 2014, Friedman et al. 2014, Kolay et al. 2014, Dong et al. 2014a,b). Translator software can be used to convert an OpenSees model to use in HybridFEM. The option also exists to use OpenSees on the RTMDsim for conducting hybrid simulations. OpenFresco is used to provide the interface between OpenSees (where the analytical substructure and integration algorithm resides) and the experimental substructure (Marullo et al. 2008).\n\nHybrid simulations are conducted using explicit integration algorithms developed by the PI (Chen and Ricles 2008, Chen et al. 2009, Kolay and Ricles 2014, Kolay et al. 2014). These algorithms are unconditionally stable, have second-order accuracy, and do not require iteration to satisfy equilibrium of the equations of motion (making them ideal for real-time hybrid simulation). One of these algorithms is based on the KR-? method. In addition to being unconditionally stable and 2nd order accurate, the KR-? method features controllable numerical energy dissipation (i.e., numerical damping), enabling it to be used to model structures that develop significant nonlinear response involving fracture or strength degradation (e.g., non-ductile reinforced concrete structures that develop cyclic member cracking and strength degradation, Kazemibidokhti et al. 2014).\n\nThe target displacements of a test structure (i.e., experimental substructure) are precisely achieved in real-time using an actuator control law that is based on an advanced adaptive delay compensation algorithm developed by the PI (Chae et al. 2013d). The algorithm uses feedback signals from the measured state of the test structure to ensure that the test structure target displacements are accurately achieved. This is accomplished by avoiding displacement errors from developing in the simulation due to both actuator and test fixture dynamics (Dong et al. 2014b, Chae 2014). For multi-directional experiments it is necessary to correct for kinematic errors in real-time that effect actuator control. The testing protocol uses kinematic compensation to avoid developing kinematic errors in multi-directional experiments that is based on an algorithm developed by the PI (Mercan et al. 2009). The algorithm accounts for the precise displaced configuration of the test structure and the actuators in determining the actuator command displacement signals issued to the servo-controller (RTMDctrl).\n\nReal-time telepresence is available using teleobservation and tele-operation equipment (RTMDtele) that is tied to the testing systems using discrete and global sensors, including high-resolution digital video and imaging capabilities, making it possible for remote collaborators and observers to access the Lehigh EF. Real-time structural system animation software has been developed (RDV 2014) to enable the real-time visualization of the response of the complete system, including analytical and experimental substructures that exist in hybrid simulations. The experimental protocol includes the use of the Lehigh Data Model (Lee et al. 2008) described in the RTMD User’s Manual to define the experiment, and enables post-testing use of archived data from a hybrid simulation that is more complete.\n\n\n\n\n\tCha, Y.J., Zhang, J., Agrawal, A., Friedman, A., Phillips, B., Ahn, R., Dong, B., Dyke, J., Spencer, B., Ricles, J., and Christenson, R.

Unique aspects of this facility are its large size and automated continuously adjustable terrain roughness field (the “Terraformer”). Eight 1.5 m diameter, 75 HP motor driven Aerovent vaneaxial fans can generate speeds of up to 18 m/s while maintaining +/ 1 fan RPM. The Terraformer consists of a 6 m x 18 m field of 1,116 individually controlled 100 mm long x 50 mm wide cuboid elements which raise out of the tunnel floor up to 160 mm each, to form a heterogeneous or homogeneous terrain field. Reconfiguration of the terrain field takes approximately 2 minutes, allowing for rapid testing of multiple terrain configurations. Models are mounted on a 1-meter (current) or 4-meter (future upgrade) diameter turntable for 360° exposure to wind direction.\n\n \n\nExperimental Protocol: The BLWT’s in-house instrumentation suite includes:\n\n\n\tA 512 channel, 625 Hz Scanivalve ZOC33 pressure scanning system mounted under the turntable.\n\tFour Turbulent Flow Instrumentation Cobra Probes that measure three components of velocity up to 2000 Hz, mounted on a traverse gantry to allow positioning anywhere within the tunnel cross-section.\n\tPitot tubes mounted at a reference height above the test section\n\tDwyer pressure sensors along tunnel walls\n\tTwo ATI Industries Nano25 6-Axis miniature load cells to quantify base forces and moments.\n\n\nBecause of its relatively large size and ability to generate a variety of approach terrains, the UF BLWT offers users tremendous flexibility. Using the standard relationship for similitude in bluff body aerodynamic testing, the parameters for model length scale, velocity scale and time scale can be adjusted to test a very wide range of possible test specimens and wind field conditions. The primary limitation is that the model does not block more than 5% of the tunnel cross section, or 0.9 m2, in order not to deviate from reference tunnel air flow characteristics.\n\nThe BLWT may be utilized to study rigid and/or aeroelastic scale models as well as other boundary-layer turbulence research topics (for example, UAVs). Typically, rigid models will utilize the Scanivalve system to quantify pressure distribution around the model envelope using built-in taps. Aeroelastic model response is quantified using a force balance and/or internal instrumentation.\n\nDepending on the specific test protocol, data output may include the following:\n\n\n\tTime-stamped Scanivalve pressure tap readings\n\tTime-stamped Dwyer and Pitot pressures/atmospheric data\n\tTime-stamped Cobra probe data\n\tBoundary layer profile\n\tTime-stamped force balance / load cell data\n\tFan motor data/system health data (RPMs, vibration, temperature)\n\tTerraformer element position data\n\n\nAll data will be archived to the CI and will be immediately available to the user for interpretation and analysis.\n\nStandard Operating Procedures\n\nScanivalve: \n\nBLWT: \nExperimental Resources\n\nUNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA POWELL FAMILY STRUCTURES AND MATERIALS LABORATORY\n\nThe UF Powell Lab includes five wind hazard research instruments:\n\n\nBoundary Layer Wind Tunnel (BLWT)\n\nMulti-Axis Wind Load Simulator (MAWLS)\n\nFigure 5: Dynamic Flow Simulator\nEquipment Resource: The DFS is used to determine ultimate wind uplift capacities of discontinuous roofing systems (such as tiles, asphalt- or metal-shingle systems), for which the uplift capacity is dependent on the geometric profile (high-profile versus near-flat profile) and effectiveness of air seals between rows of tiles. The unique features of the DFS include the maximum velocity at the test section – approximately 100 m/s – and the ability to replicate up to a 1 Hz waveforms. The DFS was designed to test full-scale roof specimens up to 2 m wide by 2.6 m long. The tile geometry affects the air leakage through the system and therefore the overall uplift loads generated. The wind field generated in a vertical plane above the shingle test specimen represents the variation of near-surface wind flowing above a roof.\n\nExperimental Protocol: During velocity simulation mode, the MAWLS pressure chamber is shut off so that air is pulled through the blower from the exterior intake, then passes through the exterior exhaust, and travels into a high-speed wind tunnel section. The wind tunnel section starts with a setting chamber, which reduces the incoming turbulence and then accelerates the airflow through a contraction duct to the target velocity at the entrance to the test section (Figure 5). The cross-section area at the entrance to the test section is 213 cm wide x 38 cm tall. The bottom part of the test section is removable to accommodate roof samples, and it has a dimension of 243 cm long x 182 cm wide. All data will be archived to the CI and will be immediately available to the user for interpretation and analysis.\n\nDepending on the specific test protocol, data output will include the following:\n\n\n\tTime-stamped target velocity\n\tTime-stamped actual velocity\n\tTime-stamped specimen-mounted instrumentation data as required (e.g. displacements, load transducers)\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedure\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: High Airflow Pressure Loading Actuator \nEquipment Resource: The HAPLA simultaneously applies time-varying wind pressure and simulated wind-driven rain on a horizontal building façade (Figure 6). Ideal for rapidly evaluating large test matrices and trials leading up to testing on the MAWLS. The HAPLA consists of two 75 HP centrifugal fans configured to operate in series. Using two fans enables the HAPLA to maintain high air through-flow (leakage) rates (up to 51 m3/min). The ducting connects to a five-port air valve that controls chamber pressure by modulating the amount of air traveling from the test chamber to the exhaust port. The valve disk is connected to a rotary actuation system that provides positioning feedback. A variable intensity water spray system (VIWSS) simulates wind-driven rain effects on building envelope systems. The VIWSS is installed within the steel chamber and consists of two separate spray racks with 25 nozzles. A National Instruments PXI system controls the pressure in the chamber through a 50 Hz Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller that receives feedback from a pressure transducer in the test chamber, which can follow rapidly varying pressures traces with high fidelity. This design enables the HAPLA to test components under simultaneous fluctuating pressure and wind-driven rain conditions, up to a 3 Hz waveform at pressures up to 6 kPa.\n\nExperimental Protocol: The design of the HAPLA allows a wide variety of test setups and protocols. The size of the test chamber can be modified for component sizes up to 2.4 x 2.4 meters. Users will be able to choose from a library of pre-configured test types, such as air permeability or pressure. The facility is set up to evaluate durability issues by testing newly built wall systems against weathered building components. Users can choose from a library of test protocols, such as static, sinusoidal or realistic wind pressure trace for pressure tests, and acquire the test data for load and response via standard data acquisition interfaces. All test protocols and acquisition algorithms are customizable to ensure optimal experimental conditions. Control of the test protocol and data acquisition are handled within a common LabVIEW interface so that a common trigger can initiate both testing and data acquisition, ensuring time compatibility of the load and response data. All data will be archived to the CI and will be immediately available to the user for interpretation and analysis. The output of the HAPLA is includes the following data:\n\n\n\tTime-stamped target pressure\n\tTime-stamped actual pressure\n\tTime-stamped PLA valve position\n\tPID control parameters (e.g., gain, derivative gain, integral gain, error)\n\tDAQ Tasks output data (in engineering unit specified in NI Max)\n\tTime-stamped water flow rate data (if applicable)\n\tTime-stamped specimen-mounted instrumentation data as required (e.g. displacements, strains)\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedure\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Multi-Axis Wind Load Simulator with test specimen in place \n \n\nFigure 4:  Photographs of garage door (a) before testing; and (b) at failure\nEquipment Resource: The MAWLS is a unique large-scale dynamic wind effects simulator that imposes dynamic air pressure in combination with static in-plane shear or uplift forces. The system is designed to accommodate walls, components, or cladding specimens up to 6 m tall by 8 m wide. This system supports the study of the interaction between static uplift or in-plane shear and time-varying pressure conditions to a level associated with an intense Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale category 5 hurricane or an EF5 tornado. Peak pressures in excess of 20 kPa while sustaining air flow in excess of 2,000 m3/min (to compensate for leakage around/through the test specimen) can be sustained, with a frequency response of 1 Hz. The system was designed to operate over a wide range of leakage conditions and changes in volume caused by specimens deflecting out-of-plane.\n\nThere are four principal components for the simulator: a fan, ducting, a control system, and the pressure chamber (Figure 2).\n\n\nFigure 2: MAWLS Components\n\n\nFive dampers (valves) comprise the control system: four butterfly dampers and a custom-built fast-acting opposed blade louver damper. The purpose of the four butterfly dampers is to change the flow configuration so that positive or negative pressure can be applied to the specimen, or alternatively bypass the chamber to drive air through a high-speed wind tunnel section. The louver damper modulates the system resistance, which changes the airflow in/out of the pressure chamber and thus causes a corresponding change in the pressure acting on the specimen (i.e., the operating point on the fan curve changes). Two differential transducers measure pressure inside the test chamber at a sampling rate of 120 Hz to drive the feedback mechanism for the louver damper. The control/feedback process is continuous; only analog feedback/control was implemented (no A/D or D/A is implemented). The control system allows the user to select a step-and-hold input (setting a pressure level to be maintained indefinitely), input from a function generator (for example a sine wave with defined mean, amplitude and frequency), or a trace (CSV input file containing the time history of a measured or simulated wind pressure signal).\n\nThe test specimen is mounted in the reaction frame that is clamped to the open side of the pressure chamber to close the pressure chamber for testing. The pressure chamber is 7.3 m wide x 5.5 m high x 1 m deep. The reaction frame system consists of primary and secondary reaction frames. The primary frame resists the catenary forces developed from the test specimen subjected to wind pressure loading and is fixed, while the secondary reaction frame can be removed and resized to accommodate the dimensions of the specimen (Figure 3).\n\nThe MAWLS operates in two modes:\n\n\n\tPressure simulation where dynamic wind pressure is applied to large wall cladding and component systems, such as a commercial rolling door or a wall on a metal building. The instrument can apply static (steady) or time-varying positive or negative pressure conditions.\n\tVelocity simulation where turbulent airflow conditions over a roof deck are simulated to load discontinuous roof systems (e.g., tile and shingles), which is the Dynamic Flow Simulator (DFS, see below).\n\n\nExperimental Protocol: The design of the MAWLS allows a wide variety of test setups and protocols. The size of the test chamber can be modified for component sizes in excess of 7 x 5 meters. The pressure box frame is designed to withstand large catenary forces generated by out-of-plane loading, and allows for significant out-of-plane displacements (see photos below). Users may choose from a library of test protocols, such as static, sinusoidal or realistic wind pressure trace for pressure tests, and acquire the test data for load and response via standard data acquisition interfaces. All test protocols and acquisition algorithms are customizable to ensure optimal experimental conditions. All data will be archived to the CI and will be immediately available to the user for interpretation and analysis.\n\nDepending on the specific test protocol, data output will include the following:\n\n\n\tTime-stamped target pressure\n\tTime-stamped actual pressure\n\tTime-stamped specimen-mounted instrumentation data as required (e.g. displacements, strains)\n\tTime-stamped photographs of specimen performance as dictated by the user (e.g. Figure 4)\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedure\n\n\n\nFigure 7:  Spatiotemporal Pressure Loading Actuator\n\nEquipment Resource: The Spatiotemporal Pressure Loading Actuator (SPLA) is a similar instrument to the MAWLS and HAPLA, but is an array of four independent Pressure Load Actuators (PLAs) which can be simultaneously controlled to apply independent pressure traces on separate regions of a single test specimen (Figure 7). The key features of the SPLA design is that it a) produces wind loads up to a Category 5 Hurricane (i.e. +5 kPa to -10 kPa range; b) can follow a pressure trace with high accuracy for a range of surface area; c) has a frequency response of up to of 4-6 Hz; and d) can operate with substantial air leakage (12 – 60 m3/min) through cracks in the building materials. The performance characteristics of the PLA depend on the size of the test chamber used. An independent servomotor controls the position of the rotating disc within each PLA which adjusts the chamber pressure. Each PLA is portable, and independently positioned depending on location of the sub-chambers for the experiment. A pressure transducer within each sub-chamber monitors the pressure and provides feedback to the each PLA. The four PLAs are networked together and controlled through a single PC-based control program.\n\nExperimental Protocol: The user is able to choose from a library of test protocols, such as static, sinusoidal or realistic wind pressure trace for pressure tests, and acquire the test data for load and response via standard data acquisition interfaces.

The four PLAs are networked together and controlled through a single PC-based control program.\n\nExperimental Protocol: The user is able to choose from a library of test protocols, such as static, sinusoidal or realistic wind pressure trace for pressure tests, and acquire the test data for load and response via standard data acquisition interfaces. All test protocols and acquisition algorithms are customizable to ensure optimal experimental conditions. Control of the test protocol and data acquisition are handled within a common LabVIEW interface so that a common trigger can initiate both testing and data acquisition, ensuring time compatibility of the load and response data. All data will be archived to the CI and will be immediately available to the user for interpretation and analysis. The output of the SPLA is a single Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) file that contains the following data for each PLA:\n\n\n\tTime-stamped target pressure\n\tTime-stamped actual pressure\n\tTime-stamped PLA valve position\n\tPID control parameters (e.g., gain, derivative gain, integral gain, error)\n\tDAQ Tasks output data (in engineering unit specified in NI Max)\n\tTime-stamped specimen-mounted instrumentation data as required (e.g. displacements, strains)\n\n\nStandard Operating Procedure\n\n\n\nPowell Laboratory Safety Manual\n\n\n\nSpatiotemporal Pressure Loading Actuator (SPLA)\n\nHigh Airflow Pressure Loading Actuator (HAPLA)\n\nDynamic Flow Simulator (DFS)\n ","slug":"equipment","django_ct":"cms.page","page_id":null,"id":"cms.page.163"}}

Once users determine their schedule, users should contact the site Operations Manager (Farnyuh Menq, fymenq@utexas.edu) to add the test date to the calendar.\n\nMost field tests include at least one of the five mobile shakers (T-REX, Liquidator, Thumper, Raptor, and Rattler), the instrumentation van or instrumentation trailer, and three University of Texas field personnel (typically the driver/hydraulics technician, field manager, and data acquisition specialist). If T-Rex, Liquidator, Raptor or Rattler is selected for a project, the tractor-trailer rig (“Big Rig”) will be needed for transportation. The fuel-supply truck will also be needed for delivering fuel and for carrying critical spare parts and tools. The number of sensors typically used for each project varies from a few to 100, depending on the project scope. All NHERI@UTexas sensors are calibrated or verified prior to testing and after each field experiment. In addition, if requested, we can fabricate special sensors, such as the push-in geophones and pore-pressure transducers used for in-situ soil liquefaction tests. However, the costs of fabricate special sensors need to be paid by the users.\n\nPer university and liability insurance policies, only properly trained personnel from the University of Texas may operate the field equipment. If more than one mobile shaker is requested, additional UT field personnel may be required. A typical field experiment is about 10 days long, and a typical field day is about 10 hours long. It takes about 5 days to prepare, verify, and pack all equipment before the field trip, 2 to 3 days of travel to and from the site, and another 3 days to unpack, clean and verify all equipment upon return. Considering overtime pay, each field experiment typically requires a total of 1.2 to 1.5 months of effort.

Brown Jr., Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) from 2009 to 2015, leads the NCO team. He is joined on the team by Purdue faculty Professor Antonio Bobet from civil engineering who brings extensive geotechnical engineering expertise, and Professor David R. Johnson from industrial engineering and political science who applies interdisciplinary methods and cutting-edge scientific research to inform policy making. The team is partnering with co-principal investigators Dean JoAnn Browning of the University of Texas at San Antonio, with great experience as a researcher and administrator, a strong commitment to student success and expertise in structural engineering, earthquake engineering, engineering materials, and reinforced concrete design and analysis; Professor Billy L. Edge of North Carolina State University, a coastal engineering expert with extensive experience with mitigating tsunami and storm surge impacts; and Professor Delong Zuo of Texas Tech University, an expert in structural dynamics and wind loads on structures. Additional key senior personnel are practicing earthquake engineer William Holmes with extensive experience in development of codes and guidelines; architect Thomas Smith with expertise in windstorm damage; Dr. Cheryl Ann Blain a research oceanographer of the Naval Research Laboratory, Oceanography Division, a recognized leader in the application of numerical models based on unstructured grids to coastal dynamics, with notable expertise in numerical tide and storm surge modeling; and Professor Ian Robertson from the University of Hawaii, Manoa, who is a leading expert in tsunami and coastal engineering research.\n\nPlans for Year-1\n\nIn the first year of the award the NCO is charged with leading the nation’s multi-hazards community in the development of the five-year research agenda that will elucidate grand challenges, key questions, and research objectives for earthquake, wind, coastal engineering and social sciences communities. We envision the five-Year NHERI Science Plan being developed in two steps. As required in the NHERI solicitation, as soon as all NHERI components have been awarded, we will convene the NHERI Council and collect all awardee Science Plan components and establish a task group to develop the first draft in the first three months of the award starting July 1, 2016. The entire process will be community-driven by collecting broad input and ideas from a number of stakeholders and engaging recognized leaders in the earthquake, wind, coastal engineering fields and the social sciences in the task group to synthesize that input into a comprehensive plan. In October of this year, we intend to make the first draft of the plan available to the other two governance groups of NHERI, the Network Independent Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the User Forum, as these groups are brought on-line for review and comment. We envision the first draft of the science plan ready for public comment around March of 2017. At the end of a four-week public review process, comments will be organized and addressed by the task group prior to publishing the first NHERI Science Plan on the NHERI website (designsafe-ci.org). We will be proactive in the process of gathering input from the community using a combination of collection techniques including the NEHRI cyberinfrastructure (web survey and discussion board), targeted questions to facility personnel and researchers, and interviews of code and standards-writing agencies and practitioners. With this process, we will be ready to post the plan on the NHERI website by June 30th 2017 to serve as a resource for the community as it develops research and education proposals for submission to NSF funding opportunities.\n\nKey activities involving the community participation as described in the previous paragraph include the Science Plan development, and in the governance by responding positively to invitations to serve on the NHERI NIAC and in the population of the User Forum. This latter group will bring the input of the community into our operations, assess the effectiveness of the support to the users, and contribute to the NCO and NHERI efforts to build a community of satisfied and engaged users while recognizing the volunteer nature of the group. The User Forum will also be extremely valuable for technology transfer, dissemination of impact, and sharing lessons learned and experiences of the various hazard communities. As required by the NHERI solicitation, the User Forum will be populated with representatives from the broad scientific and engineering communities served by NHERI, elected by the user community. As prescribed in the NHERI solicitation, the NIAC will be populated with input from the Council of awardees. This committee’s distinguished membership will encompass the areas of activity of NHERI so that the community is properly represented in this important governance committee.\n\nMultiple other avenues for community participation will be available through the various NHERI-wide education and community outreach activities led by the NCO. For example, the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, Summer Institute for early career faculty and practicing engineers and architects, graduate students, and K-12 teachers, and NCO committees such as the Scheduling Committee, Education and Community Outreach Committee and others. We are excited about the opportunities before us and look forward to listening to your needs and working with you to achieve the NHERI vision of global research infrastructure where users are empowered to achieve enhanced national resilience and sustainability of civil infrastructure with fewer fatalities, less interruption to societal functions, and reduced economic loss by reducing the impact of earthquakes, windstorms and associated natural hazards such as tsunami and storm surge.\n\nBest regards,\nOn behalf of the NCO Team\nProf. Julio A.

FIU’s revolutionary Wall of Wind (WOW) Experimental Facility (EF), supported by a Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) grant from the National Science Foundation, is playing a major part in achieving the needed R&amp;D breakthroughs.\n\nA 2-fan WOW was assembled in 2005 by FIU’s wind engineering team. The RenaissanceRe 6-fan WOW, generating winds up to 120 mph, was subsequently built for specialized wind engineering studies. The latest version of WOW features 12 fans and is capable of replicating Category 5 (Hurricane Andrew strength) winds. It was inaugurated on the 20th anniversary of Andrew’s landfall.\n\nThe WOW has been used over the years to study how structures such as homes and critical infrastructure systems hold up in extreme wind and rain conditions. This research is leading to advances that will help to prevent the collapse of homes, hospitals, traffic signals, transportation systems, and other infrastructure.\n\nThe WOW facility has been used effectively since its inception. Past research topics studied at the WOW includes hurricane wind load assessment on roof top equipment, mitigation of roof uplift through vortex suppression techniques, the performance of roof-to-wall connections and roof coverings (e.g., pavers, tiles, shingles), and the mitigation of extreme wind pressure by scientifically designed architectural elements.\n\nFor Chowdhury, being able to work at the WOW facility is a source of deep personal satisfaction. His personal experience in the aftermath of a Florida hurricane added much to the exhilarating experience of working with his research team.\n\nChowdhury muses: “It’s gratifying to see the advances in hurricane engineering made possible by WOW research.” He remembers witnessing the destruction that even a CAT 2 hurricane can wreak, as he arrived in Miami during a major power outage in the aftermath of Hurricane Wilma. He adds: “Our team developed the facility we now use in research that can mitigate hurricane impacts in the future. This means a lot to me.”\n\nDr. Chowdhury says that working at a one-of-a-kind facility like the WOW has been engrossing. “I think wind engineering as a discipline is undergoing a paradigm shift. Facilities such as the WOW can be used to perform large scale testing at high speeds.

FIU’s revolutionary Wall of Wind (WOW) Experimental Facility (EF), supported by a Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) grant from the National Science Foundation, is playing a major part in achieving the needed R&amp;D breakthroughs.\n\nA 2-fan WOW was assembled in 2005 by FIU’s wind engineering team. The RenaissanceRe 6-fan WOW, generating winds up to 120 mph, was subsequently built for specialized wind engineering studies. The latest version of WOW features 12 fans and is capable of replicating Category 5 (Hurricane Andrew strength) winds. It was inaugurated on the 20th anniversary of Andrew’s landfall.\n\nThe WOW has been used over the years to study how structures such as homes and critical infrastructure systems hold up in extreme wind and rain conditions. This research is leading to advances that will help to prevent the collapse of homes, hospitals, traffic signals, transportation systems, and other infrastructure.\n\nThe WOW facility has been used effectively since its inception. Past research topics studied at the WOW includes hurricane wind load assessment on roof top equipment, mitigation of roof uplift through vortex suppression techniques, the performance of roof-to-wall connections and roof coverings (e.g., pavers, tiles, shingles), and the mitigation of extreme wind pressure by scientifically designed architectural elements.\n\nFor Chowdhury, being able to work at the WOW facility is a source of deep personal satisfaction. His personal experience in the aftermath of a Florida hurricane added much to the exhilarating experience of working with his research team.\n\nChowdhury muses: “It’s gratifying to see the advances in hurricane engineering made possible by WOW research.” He remembers witnessing the destruction that even a CAT 2 hurricane can wreak, as he arrived in Miami during a major power outage in the aftermath of Hurricane Wilma. He adds: “Our team developed the facility we now use in research that can mitigate hurricane impacts in the future. This means a lot to me.”\n\nDr. Chowdhury says that working at a one-of-a-kind facility like the WOW has been engrossing. “I think wind engineering as a discipline is undergoing a paradigm shift. Facilities such as the WOW can be used to perform large scale testing at high speeds. Our research will help to understand the weaknesses exhibited by buildings, power and traffic systems, and infrastructure in hurricanes. This will enable us to develop better designs and to provide engineers, builders and designers with the knowledge they need to achieve a more resilient built environment.”\n\nOn August 1, 2016, a research team led by principal investigator Dr.  Abdollah Shafieezadeh of the Ohio State University and co-principal investigator Dr. Arindam Chowdhury started using the NHERI 12-fan WOW EF to investigate how to help electric power infrastructure perform better in hurricanes.\n\nAccording to Shafieezadeh and Chowdhury, the electric power transmission infrastructure in the United States, especially in coastal areas, faces substantial risks from hurricanes and other windstorms.

Soil and soil-structure systems play a large role in how structures respond to earthquakes and at the University of California at Davis (UC Davis) Center for Geotechnical Modeling, researchers are working with Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) to make engineering advances in soil and soil-structure systems.\n\nThe UC Davis campus center features access to world-class geotechnical modeling resources, including 9-m and 1-m radius centrifuges with shaking tables. The 9-m centrifuge features the largest radius of any centrifuge featuring a shake table in the world and is capable of carrying a model payload ten times greater than any other academic centrifuge in the United States.\n\nPerforming experiments on detailed reduced-scale models equipped with large numbers of sensors enables major scientific and engineering advances for a wide range of soil and soil-structure systems. Everything from building foundations, to bridge foundations, near-shore and offshore energy infrastructure foundations, underground structures, pipelines, ground improvement technologies, wharves, embankments, dams and levee systems can benefit from the research being done.\n\nThe research being performed will enable major advances in the ability of engineers to predict and improve how soil and soil structures will perform when dealing with earthquakes, waves, wind and storm surge loadings.\n\nAccording to the UC Davis website, the research performed at the facility will contribute to the economic competiveness of the United States, better infrastructure management, and improved well-being of citizens through, for example, modified building codes, new seismic design criteria, and partnering projects for major infrastructure systems.\n\nTwo new research projects have gotten underway at UC Davis since July 2016 with a third one set to begin on Oct. 1, 2016.\n\nThe first of the newest projects kicked off on July 15, 2016. The research focuses on soil-foundation-structure interaction effects on cyclic failure potential of silts and clays.  Earthquake induced ground failure has resulted in billions of dollars of damages during recent earthquakes.\n\nSoils are characterized as either sand-like or clay-like with respect to loss of strength during earthquakes. Liquefaction of sand-like soils is more broadly understood than clay-like soils.  The research hopes to help provide a better understanding of the conditions that cause clay-like soils to fail during an earthquake. According to the UC Davis abstract on the research this project will enable engineers to better predict conditions for which cyclic failure of \"clay-like\" soil will and will not occur during earthquakes. This will enhance public safety by reducing the risk of future structural failures.\n\nThe second of the new research projects began on Aug. 1, 2016. The research is a collaborative project with universities from around the world focusing on the validation of constitutive and numerical modeling techniques for soil liquefaction analysis.\n\nWith soil liquefaction being a pervasive problem during earthquakes, practicing engineers and academics have been using computational models and numerical simulation tools to design and analyze geosystems involving liquefiable soils.  These tools are often revised after major past earthquakes to incorporate lessons learned from post-event observations and investigations.\n\nAs the tools are ever evolving the validity of them is not yet fully established. Through this collaborative project a set of high quality experimental data will be produced then used to establish the validity and range of applicability of existing computational models and simulation procedures for soil liquefaction analysis.\n\nThe third of the new projects begins on Oct. 1, 2016 and will focus on liquefaction evaluations of finely interlayered sands, silts, and clays. Recent earthquakes have shown that current engineering procedures have a tendency to over-predict liquefaction effects in thinly interlayered sand, silt and clay deposits.\n\nThe goal of this research is to eliminate the bias and overestimating of potential damages. This can help reduce needless spending on things such as ground improvement and structural strengthening efforts.\n\nDan Wilson, the associate director at the Center for Geotechnical Modeling, notes that all of the work being done at the UC Davis facility will tie in with other projects from around the globe.

As a result, researchers will want to store and share their data in the DesignSafe data repository, even if not required to do so, because of the access to these capabilities. To achieve this vision, DesignSafe will provide a flexible data repository with straightforward mechanisms for data/metadata upload and will enable the next generation of research discovery through a cloud-based interface that allows data analysis and visualization tools to work directly on data stored in the data repository. These functionalities will allow researchers to use the CI to interact with their data in the cloud, bypassing time-consuming downloads/uploads. Not only will the cloud-based interface allow researchers to analyze, visualize, and integrate data, but they will also be able to share analysis scripts and link tasks to support workflows that facilitate research discovery.\n\nDesignSafe-ci.org web portal\n\nThe portal will be a primary point of entry for users of the DesignSafe capabilities and the NHERI community. The portal will provide NHERI wide information on experimental facilities, the Facility Scheduling Dashboard, and Education and Community Outreach (ECO) activities. To ensure maximum interoperability with diverse software architectures and modes of access, the portal will be developed according to current web standards for accessibility and performance, ensuring a consistent and responsive experience on any modern web browser or mobile device. Furthermore, the portal will be powered by an extensive set of flexible and reusable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), enabling full programmatic access to all aspects of the center’s infrastructure.\n\nData Depot\n\nAt the heart of the cyberinfrastructure, the Data Depot is the central shared data repository that supports the full research lifecycle, from data creation to analysis to curation and publication. One of its fundamental components is stability, which assures both reliability of the processes that are conducted and data sustainability. The Data Depot is built upon a foundation of a multi-petabyte repository that features mirroring between two physical sites and the option of a third copy in a tape archive so that data is continuously safeguarded and can be recovered in case of disasters. The system is monitored continuously (24/7) by staff on site, and is protected by both firewalls and an intrusion detection system (IDS). Long-term preservation involves sound system administration practices, a stable infrastructure, as well as policies and their right implementation and monitoring. For DesignSafe, these aspects are addressed in collaboration with the University of Texas Libraries who provide critical expertise to assure long-term access to sustainable data.\n\nThe Data Depot will support connection of metadata to all data objects through tools that facilitate data organization and description and allow the metadata tagging to occur progressively during the research phase, as the data is being created, used, and curated. This will enhance data publication, as well as data discovery and understandability for reuse. The Data Depot also must provide an intuitive interface with data to facilitate user’s interaction with the data. Upload/download of data is streamlined through a range of interactive and automated options for both single file and bulk transfer, including drag and drop file upload, federation with existing cloud data services (e.g. Box.com, Dropbox, S3, or Google Drive), command line interfaces that can be automated by power users, and interactive web tools that will lead the user through an interactive interface to input data and create the minimum necessary metadata. The Data Depot will accept any data the user wishes to supply into a local workspace, even if the data type is unknown or only partial metadata is provided.\n\nThe Data Depot provides direct support for data sharing and collaboration. DesignSafe supports the sharing of all objects in the CI - with a simple click, data from a user’s private directory can be shared with a peer or a research team, or with the entire public through the web. Data may be a file, a set of notes from the Discovery Workspace, an image, a movie, or a link to a saved workspace to allow a collaborator to perform the same analysis. In addition, users will be able to access a control list to enable permissions to the data.  Also possible is to set a unique public URL to a dataset and create a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) to it. \n\n\nDiscovery Workspace\n\nThe Discovery Workspace will be a web-based environment that provides researchers with access to data analysis tools, computational simulation tools, visualization tools, educational tools, and user-contributed tools within the cloud to support research workflows, learning, and discovery. The portal will provide a desktop metaphor, with a data window to give the user access to the contents of the Data Depot (which includes experimental, simulation, and reconnaissance data, as well as others) and a tools window giving the user access to a list of available tools, scripts, etc. For example, Figure 2 shows an embedded R Workspace that is currently available from the TACC Analytics Portal and allows researchers to use the program R to analyze their data. This type of interface within the Discovery Workspace will allow users to take advantage of powerful analysis capabilities to fully investigate and explore their data, all within the cloud.\n\nThe software tools made available within the Discovery Workspace will be identified through discussions with the NHERI research community and will also include those developed by the SimCenter awardee. Our initial discussions with a subset of the community have identified a range of new software tools that are of interest to the community. These tools encompass both data analytics and visualization tools (e.g. MATLAB, ParaView), as well as computational simulation tools (e.g., OpenSees, ABAQUS, ADCIRC, OpenFOAM). Additionally, the tools span all of the technical domains included in NHERI. In particular, the wind community has unique computational simulation and data requirements through its use of Database Assisted Design, called DAD. We will facilitate and promote DAD through the availability of wind data from multiple sources and a suite of DAD simulation tools (e.g., windPRESSURE from NIST) within the Discover Workspace. DesignSafe will make commercial codes available through a “Bring-Your-Own-License” approach, which allows the CI to confirm that a user has an active license for the software at their home institution. This functionality has been used at TACC for widely-used software packages, such as MATLAB. We will expand the “Bring-Your-OwnLicense” functionality to the commercial software packages required for the NHERI community.\n\nThe Discovery Workspace will be implemented using TACC’s highly scalable and extensible Agave science-as-a-service platform, which is the evolution of the successful iPlant Foundation API (Dooley et al. 2012). Agave has generalized the core functionality of the Foundation API to provide a science-as-aservice platform for gateway development that works seamlessly in High Performance Computing (HPC), campus, commercial, and cloud environments alike. Using Agave as a platform to develop the Discovery Workspace will provide several advantages:\n\n\n\tAgave provides many of the features necessary for developing a portal that makes use of complicated computational infrastructure.\n\tAgave’s simple, RESTful, programming interfaces provides a straightforward, language agnostic method of integration of existing data and content, and for building web interfaces for other awardees in the program.\n\tAgave has built-in functionality for tracking and recreating workflows, enabling provenance tracking and experiment reproducibility.\n\n\nReconnaissance Integration Portal\n\nThe Reconnaissance Integration Portal will be the main access point to data collected during the reconnaissance of windstorm and earthquake events. These data may be collected by the RAPID experimental facility, its users, or other researchers participating in reconnaissance. The reconnaissance data may include infrastructure performance data (e.g., damage estimates, ground movements, subsurface information), remotely sensed data (e.g., photos, video, LIDAR point clouds, satellite imagery data), or human experiential data (e.g., social media data, societal impact data). These data represent diverse data types with different metadata requirements, but their use hinges on information regarding the location from which the data were collected. Therefore, a geospatial framework (GoogleEarth and GIS) will be used to interface with much of the data to provide the contextual location of the data with respect to the windstorm or earthquake event. The reconnaissance data will be physically located in the Data Depot and accessible by analytics and visualization tools, but the Reconnaissance Integration Portal will provide the initial interface to the data. TACC has developed geospatial interfaces for other and will take advantage of this experience to develop the Reconnaissance Integration Portal in coordination with the RAPID facility awardee. Our collaboration with the RAPID facility awardee will ensure that we meet the needs of this community.\n\nLearning Center\n\nThe Learning Center will be the central repository for self-paced, on demand materials to teach users (e.g., undergraduate students, graduate students, researchers, and faculty) to take advantage of the CI capabilities of DesignSafe. The availability of on demand instructional materials at DesignSafe will ensure that the NHERI community has access to training when and where they need it. Online materials in the Learning Center will be built based on the principle that online content requires attention to format and content unique to the interactive online metaphor; simple posting of slide decks and recorded lectures are insufficient. Learning Center modules will be interactive, include exercises, and navigation to allow users to mark and save progress, and jump quickly to needed content. The Learning Center will be extensible, and support publication of modules developed by all NHERI awardees.\n\nDeveloper’s Portal\n\nThe Developer’s Portal will be the central place for users and developers wishing to extend the capabilities of the DesignSafe infrastructure. Through the portal, users can access a tool builder which will support the deployment of new Apps (ranging from simple data conversion scripts to complex simulation applications) to the Discovery Workspace, or access complete information on the DesignSafe Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). All capabilities of DesignSafe will be exposed through the API layer. While most users will simply use the Discovery Workspace, Data Depot, or Reconnaissance Integration Portal, all of the capabilities in these tools will be exposed to programmers through the API. API functions will include the ability to ingest or download data, run analysis jobs, translate data types, or create public identifiers for data. Through this interface, users can embed DesignSafe capabilities in other applications. The Developer’s Portal transforms the DesignSafe from simply a static web application built by the design team, to a user extensible “App store” that can grow with changes in the community and the creativity of individual research teams.\nDesignSafe will be comprised of the following services and components (Figure 1):\n\n\n\tDesignSafe-ci.org front end web portal\n\tThe Data Depot, a multi-purpose data repository for experimental, simulation, and field data that uses a flexible data model applicable to diverse and large data sets and is accessible from other DesignSafe components.\n\tA web-based Discovery Workspace that represents a flexible, extensible environment for data access, analysis, computational simulation, and visualization.\n\tA Reconnaissance Integration Portal that facilitates sharing of reconnaissance data within a geospatial framework.\n\tA Learning Center that provides training and online access to tutorials.\n\tA Developer’s Portal that provides a venue for power users to extend the Discovery Workspace or Reconnaissance Integration Portal, and to develop their own applications to take advantage of the DesignSafe infrastructure’s capabilities.\n\tA foundation of storage and compute systems, to provide both on-demand computing and access to scalable computing resources.\n\tA middleware layer to expose the capabilities of the CI to developers, and to enable construction of diverse web and mobile interfaces to data products and analysis capabilities\n\tA marketplace of Community Defined Interfaces; the extension capability of the CI will allow other projects to leverage DesignSafe to build an interface of their own choosing; we expect, for instance, to work with each EF awardee to provide a unique interface to their facility and its data.\n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 1: Proposed Architecture of DesignSafe\n\n \n\n\n ","django_id":"719","title":"Cyberinfrastructure Description","url":"https://designsafe-ci.org/community/cyberinfrastructure","text":"Cyber­infrastructure\nDescription\n\n DesignSafe-ci.org will provide a comprehensive environment for experimental, theoretical, and computational engineering and science, providing a place not only to steward data from its creation through archive, but also the workspace in which to understand, analyze, collaborate and publish that data. \n\nOur vision is that DesignSafe will be an integral part of research and discovery, providing researchers access to cloud-based tools that support their work to analyze, visualize, and integrate diverse data types. As a result, researchers will want to store and share their data in the DesignSafe data repository, even if not required to do so, because of the access to these capabilities.

DesignSafe will persistently maintain all uploaded data on storage resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, and these resources are redundant and geographically replicated. DesignSafe operates a dedicated Fedora repository platform to ensure the authenticity, integrity, security and persistence of published datasets for open access. \n\n \n\nMinimum Metadata Requirements\n\nOverview of minimal metadata implementation in DesignSafe\n\nMetadata is information that describes data. Schemas provide a structured way for users to share metadata within and across domains. Schemas typically include labels (or, elements) and their definitions, and may have different levels of descriptive granularity.\n\nBecause there is no standard schema to describe natural hazards engineering research and data, DesignSafe offers metadata sets to describe key components of datasets in the CI. These were developed in close consultation with researchers and Experimental Facilities. All of the community terms gathered for use in DesignSafe are documented in an interactive meta-dictionary called YAMZ, along with their definitions. The terms are evolving, and they can and will be expanded, updated and corrected with input from the community as DesignSafe curation pipelines become more widely adopted.\n\nDesignSafe’s metadata approach maps community terms to elements of widely-used, standardized schemas so that metadata can be exchanged with other platforms. Elements from the NEES data model are also included. The schemas to which terms have been mapped are: Dublin Core for description of the research project and the data publication, PROV to display provenance relationships between data and the processes from which it derives, and DataCite for DOI assignment and citation.\n\nDue to variations in research domains and their methods, users may not need to use all of the elements available to describe their research. However, we identified a minimum set of metadata terms that represent the structure of the data, are useful for discovery, and will allow proper citation of data. When users request to publish data in the CI, the system will check for completeness of these core terms and whether data are associated with them. To ensure the quality of published data in DesignSafe’s Data Depot, publication will be granted once the minimum standard is completed by the user or research team. The minimum element set is shown below.\n\nKEY (to help understand usage of the terms in the minimum set)\n\n(bold) Denotes the structure of the data. For example, an experimental project may have more than one experiment and more than one corresponding analysis.\n\n(*) The metadata is repeatable, with multiple entries allowed.\n\n($) Recommended if exists. For example, not every project will include an analysis.\n \n\nExperimental Research Project\n\n\n\tDOI\n\tTitle\n\tAuthor*\n\tParticipant_institution*\n\tProject_type*\n\tDescription\n\tPublisher\n\tDate_of_publication\n\tRights\n\tAssociated_project*$\n\tFunding_agency_ and_award_number*\n\tKeywords\n\tExperiment*\n\t\n\t\tDOI\n\t\tTitle\n\t\tAuthor*\n\t\tDescription\n\t\tDate_of_publication\n\t\tExperimental_facility\n\t\tExperiment_type\n\t\tEquipment_type*\n\t\tModel_configuration*\n\t\tSensor_information*\n\t\tEvent*\n\t\tReport$\n\t\n\t\n\tAnalysis*$\n\t\n\t\tDOI\n\t\tTitle\n\t\tAuthor*\n\t\tDescription\n\t\tDate_of_publication\n\t\tReferenced data*\n\t\n\t\n\n \n\nSimulation Research Project\n\n\n\tDOI\n\tTitle\n\tAuthor*\n\tParticipant_institution*\n\tProject_type*\n\tDescription\n\tPublisher\n\tDate_of_publication\n\tRights\n\tAssociated_project*$\n\tFunding_agency_and_ award_number*\n\tKeywords\n\tSimulation_type\n\tApplication_and_version\n\tNatural_hazard_type\n\tModel_configuration*\n\tReferenced_model$\n\tInput_load*\n\tEvent*\n\tAnalysis*$\n\t\n\t\tTitle\n\t\tDescription\n\t\tReferenced_data*$\n\t\n\t\n\n \n\nHybrid Simulation Research Project\n\n\n\tDOI\n\tTitle\n\tAuthor*\n\tParticipant_institution*\n\tProject_type*\n\tDescription\n\tPublisher\n\tDate_of_publication\n\tRights\n\tAssociated_project*$\n\tFunding_agency_ and_award_number*\n\tKeywords\n\tGlobal_Model\n\t\n\t\tMaster_Simulation _Coordinator\n\t\t\n\t\t\tApplication_ and_version\n\t\t\tSimulated_system\n\t\t\tNatural_hazard_type\n\t\t\tInput_load*\n\t\t\tEvent*\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSimulation*\n\t\t\n\t\t\tApplication_and_version\n\t\t\tSimulated_system\n\t\t\tInput_load*\n\t\t\tEvent*\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tExperiment*\n\t\t\n\t\t\tModel_configuration*\n\t\t\tSensor_information*\n\t\t\tEvent*\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n \n\nField Reconnaissance Research Project\n\n\n\tDOI\n\tTitle\n\tAuthor*\n\tParticipant_institution*\n\tProject_type*\n\tDescription\n\tPublisher\n\tDate_of_publication\n\tRights\n\tAssociated_project*$\n\tFunding_agency_ and_award_number*\n\tKeywords\n\tNatural_hazard_type\n\tNatural_hazard_event\n\tLat, long, name\n\tCoverage temporal\n\tData type*\n\n ","django_id":"793","title":"Curation Guidelines","url":"https://designsafe-ci.org/rw/curation-guidelines","text":"Data Curation &amp;\nPublication Guidelines\n\nGuidance and best practices for publishing data\n\n \n\nIntroduction\n\nData curation generates data that is easy to find and re-use because it has been organized and described.

DesignSafe will persistently maintain all uploaded data on storage resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, and these resources are redundant and geographically replicated. DesignSafe operates a dedicated Fedora repository platform to ensure the authenticity, integrity, security and persistence of published datasets for open access. \n\n \n\nMinimum Metadata Requirements\n\nOverview of minimal metadata implementation in DesignSafe\n\nMetadata is information that describes data. Schemas provide a structured way for users to share metadata within and across domains. Schemas typically include labels (or, elements) and their definitions, and may have different levels of descriptive granularity.\n\nBecause there is no standard schema to describe natural hazards engineering research and data, DesignSafe offers metadata sets to describe key components of datasets in the CI. These were developed in close consultation with researchers and Experimental Facilities. All of the community terms gathered for use in DesignSafe are documented in an interactive meta-dictionary called YAMZ, along with their definitions. The terms are evolving, and they can and will be expanded, updated and corrected with input from the community as DesignSafe curation pipelines become more widely adopted.\n\nDesignSafe’s metadata approach maps community terms to elements of widely-used, standardized schemas so that metadata can be exchanged with other platforms. Elements from the NEES data model are also included. The schemas to which terms have been mapped are: Dublin Core for description of the research project and the data publication, PROV to display provenance relationships between data and the processes from which it derives, and DataCite for DOI assignment and citation.\n\nDue to variations in research domains and their methods, users may not need to use all of the elements available to describe their research. However, we identified a minimum set of metadata terms that represent the structure of the data, are useful for discovery, and will allow proper citation of data. When users request to publish data in the CI, the system will check for completeness of these core terms and whether data are associated with them. To ensure the quality of published data in DesignSafe’s Data Depot, publication will be granted once the minimum standard is completed by the user or research team. The minimum element set is shown below.\n\nKEY (to help understand usage of the terms in the minimum set)\n\n(bold) Denotes the structure of the data. For example, an experimental project may have more than one experiment and more than one corresponding analysis.\n\n(*) The metadata is repeatable, with multiple entries allowed.\n\n($) Recommended if exists. For example, not every project will include an analysis.\n \n\nExperimental Research Project\n\n\n\tDOI\n\tTitle\n\tAuthor*\n\tParticipant_institution*\n\tProject_type*\n\tDescription\n\tPublisher\n\tDate_of_publication\n\tRights\n\tAssociated_project*$\n\tFunding_agency_ and_award_number*\n\tKeywords\n\tExperiment*\n\t\n\t\tDOI\n\t\tTitle\n\t\tAuthor*\n\t\tDescription\n\t\tDate_of_publication\n\t\tExperimental_facility\n\t\tExperiment_type\n\t\tEquipment_type*\n\t\tModel_configuration*\n\t\tSensor_information*\n\t\tEvent*\n\t\tReport$\n\t\n\t\n\tAnalysis*$\n\t\n\t\tDOI\n\t\tTitle\n\t\tAuthor*\n\t\tDescription\n\t\tDate_of_publication\n\t\tReferenced data*\n\t\n\t\n\n \n\nSimulation Research Project\n\n\n\tDOI\n\tTitle\n\tAuthor*\n\tParticipant_institution*\n\tProject_type*\n\tDescription\n\tPublisher\n\tDate_of_publication\n\tRights\n\tAssociated_project*$\n\tFunding_agency_and_ award_number*\n\tKeywords\n\tSimulation_type\n\tApplication_and_version\n\tNatural_hazard_type\n\tModel_configuration*\n\tReferenced_model$\n\tInput_load*\n\tEvent*\n\tAnalysis*$\n\t\n\t\tTitle\n\t\tDescription\n\t\tReferenced_data*$\n\t\n\t\n\n \n\nHybrid Simulation Research Project\n\n\n\tDOI\n\tTitle\n\tAuthor*\n\tParticipant_institution*\n\tProject_type*\n\tDescription\n\tPublisher\n\tDate_of_publication\n\tRights\n\tAssociated_project*$\n\tFunding_agency_ and_award_number*\n\tKeywords\n\tGlobal_Model\n\t\n\t\tMaster_Simulation _Coordinator\n\t\t\n\t\t\tApplication_ and_version\n\t\t\tSimulated_system\n\t\t\tNatural_hazard_type\n\t\t\tInput_load*\n\t\t\tEvent*\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tSimulation*\n\t\t\n\t\t\tApplication_and_version\n\t\t\tSimulated_system\n\t\t\tInput_load*\n\t\t\tEvent*\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\tExperiment*\n\t\t\n\t\t\tModel_configuration*\n\t\t\tSensor_information*\n\t\t\tEvent*\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\n \n\nField Reconnaissance Research Project\n\n\n\tDOI\n\tTitle\n\tAuthor*\n\tParticipant_institution*\n\tProject_type*\n\tDescription\n\tPublisher\n\tDate_of_publication\n\tRights\n\tAssociated_project*$\n\tFunding_agency_ and_award_number*\n\tKeywords\n\tNatural_hazard_type\n\tNatural_hazard_event\n\tLat, long, name\n\tCoverage temporal\n\tData type*\n\n ","slug":"curation-guidelines","django_ct":"cms.page","page_id":null,"id":"cms.page.793"}}

Globus is fast, for large volumes of data, as it uses multiple network sockets simultaneously to transfer data. It is reliable for large numbers of directories and files, as it can automatically fail and restart itself, and will only notify you when the transfers are completed successfully.\n\n \n\nBrowser-based File Transfer to Data Depot\n\nUser can easily transfer files and directories to their My Data or to specific projects via web browser. Data Depot provides a user interface with a familiar desktop metaphor for manipulating files. The UI for a typical \"My Data\" window is shown in below.\n\n\n\tLogin to DesignSafe - Use one of the following credentials to log into DesignSafe\n\tClick Research Workbench and navigate to Data Depot\n\tNavigate to the directory where you want your data to be uploaded. If no folder exist, create a new one by adding new folder/new project\n\tClick add then choose file upload or folder upload based on your data then click begin upload.\n\tThe \"upload\" button will open a separate form. From the upload window, you may select files via a traditional \"file manager\" browser by clicking the \"choose files\" button, or simply drag and drop files from your desktop into the \"Drop files here\" section. Once the upload is done, you can see your data in the work space\n\n\nIntegrating Dropbox and Box.com with the DesignSafe's Data Depot\n\nDesignSafe provides user the capability to connect to your favorite cloud storage provider. We currently support integrating your data from Box.com and Dropbox.com\n\nFollow the steps below to integrate your Dropbox and/or Box.com accounts into DesignSafe portal:\n\n\n\tClick Manage account on your DesignSafe account profile, then 3rd party apps as shown in the figure. Next step click manage app settings under Box.com tab\n\t\n\tSelect either Dropbox or Box.com, then grant access to the application by logging in with the respective application's credentials\n\t\n\t\n\tNow your account is integrated into DesignSafe's Data Depot. Go to your Data Depot and view the files that are in Box.com or Dropbox in your workspace\n\t\n\n\nAt this point, your data is still in Box.com or Dropbox and is simply viewable. We do not actively sync your data. In order to use your data in DesignSafe, you will need to copy the data from Box or Dropbox into My Data or My Projects.\n\nYou are just copying the data to DesignSafe, which means original data still resides in Box or Dropbox. If you make any changes to those files in My Data or My Projects, it will not be replicated at Box or Dropbox. You can copy files back to Box or Dropbox from My Data or My Projects.\n\n\nLinux Command-Line Transfer Utilities\n\nUsers can take advantage of some common command line utilities such as scp, sftp, rsync to achieve higher performance and to transfer large amount of data seamlessly. Web browsers have some restrictions on transferring data on large volume. Command line utilities may come in handy in those situations. TACC requires  (MFA) for command line access.\n\nscp\n\nData transfer from any Linux system can be accomplished using the scp utility to copy data to and from the DesignSafe. A file can be copied from your local system to the remote server by using the command:\n\nscp filename username@data.tacc.utexas.edu:/path/to/project/directory \n\nlocalhost$ scp test.txt siva@data.tacc.utexas.edu/corral-repl/projects/NHERI/projects/523309190170-242ac114-0001\n\nConsult the man pages for more information on scp.\n\nlocalhost$ man scp\n\nrsync\n\nThe rsync command is a reliable method to transfer files, especially if you transfer files in stages, as it compares files automatically to make sure that files in the source and destination are the same. It is recommended for users who need checksum method since it involves calculating checksum for each file to make sure that the transfer is complete and accurate.\n\nBelow is the usage of rsync command for transferring a file named \"myfile.c\" from the current location on your desktop to your project directory in the DesignSafe\n\nlocalhost$ rsync myfile.c username@data.tacc.utexas.edu:/corral-repl/projects/NHERI/projects/project_id\n\nAn entire directory can be transferred from source to destination by using rsync as well. For directory transfers the options \"-avtr\" will transfer the files recursively (\"-r\" option) along with the modification times (\"-t\" option) and in the archive mode (\"-a\" option) to preserve symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc. The \"-v\" option (verbose) increases the amount of information displayed during any transfer. The following example demonstrates the usage of the \"-avtr\" options for transferring a directory named \"Nheri\" from the current location on your desktop to DesignSafe's project area.\n\nlocalhost$ rsync -avtr Nheri \\\nusername@data.tacc.utexas.edu:/corral-repl/projects/NHERI/projects/project_id\n\nFor more rsync options and command details, run the command \"rsync -h\" or:\n\nlocalhost$ man scp\nlocalhost$ man rsync\n\n** If rsync is used as a mode of data transfer, existing data written to the staging area will be overwritten only if the contents change. Use --ignore-existing to change this behavior. If any other data transfer protocol is used, files or folders with an existing name will be overwritten.\n\nCyberduck\n\nCyberduck is an open source graphical user interface tool to accomplish large data transfers.\n\nClick on the \"Open Connection\" button in the top right corner of the Cyberduck window to open a connection configuration window (as shown below) transfer mechanism, and type in the server name \"data.tacc.utexas.edu\". Add your username and password in the spaces provided, and if the \"more options\" area is not shown click the small triangle or button to expand the window; this will allow you to enter the path to your project area so that when Cyberduck opens the connection you will immediately see your data. Then click the \"Connect\" button to open your connection.\n\nOnce connected, you can navigate through your remote file hierarchy using familiar graphical navigation techniques. You may also drag-and-drop files into and out of the Cyberduck window to transfer files to and from DesignSafe.\n\n\n\n \n\nLast update: August 15, 2017\n ","django_id":"852","title":"Data Transfer Guide","url":"https://designsafe-ci.org/rw/user-guides/data-transfer-guide","text":"Data Transfer\nGuide\n\nTransferring Files to DesignSafe's Data Depot\n\n \n\nDesignSafe supports multiple ways of moving data in and out of the Data Depot – which one is best depends on how you will use DesignSafe.

The UI for a typical \"My Data\" window is shown in below.\n\n\n\tLogin to DesignSafe - Use one of the following credentials to log into DesignSafe\n\tClick Research Workbench and navigate to Data Depot\n\tNavigate to the directory where you want your data to be uploaded. If no folder exist, create a new one by adding new folder/new project\n\tClick add then choose file upload or folder upload based on your data then click begin upload.\n\tThe \"upload\" button will open a separate form. From the upload window, you may select files via a traditional \"file manager\" browser by clicking the \"choose files\" button, or simply drag and drop files from your desktop into the \"Drop files here\" section. Once the upload is done, you can see your data in the work space\n\n\nIntegrating Dropbox and Box.com with the DesignSafe's Data Depot\n\nDesignSafe provides user the capability to connect to your favorite cloud storage provider. We currently support integrating your data from Box.com and Dropbox.com\n\nFollow the steps below to integrate your Dropbox and/or Box.com accounts into DesignSafe portal:\n\n\n\tClick Manage account on your DesignSafe account profile, then 3rd party apps as shown in the figure. Next step click manage app settings under Box.com tab\n\t\n\tSelect either Dropbox or Box.com, then grant access to the application by logging in with the respective application's credentials\n\t\n\t\n\tNow your account is integrated into DesignSafe's Data Depot. Go to your Data Depot and view the files that are in Box.com or Dropbox in your workspace\n\t\n\n\nAt this point, your data is still in Box.com or Dropbox and is simply viewable. We do not actively sync your data. In order to use your data in DesignSafe, you will need to copy the data from Box or Dropbox into My Data or My Projects.\n\nYou are just copying the data to DesignSafe, which means original data still resides in Box or Dropbox. If you make any changes to those files in My Data or My Projects, it will not be replicated at Box or Dropbox. You can copy files back to Box or Dropbox from My Data or My Projects.\n\n\nLinux Command-Line Transfer Utilities\n\nUsers can take advantage of some common command line utilities such as scp, sftp, rsync to achieve higher performance and to transfer large amount of data seamlessly. Web browsers have some restrictions on transferring data on large volume. Command line utilities may come in handy in those situations. TACC requires  (MFA) for command line access.\n\nscp\n\nData transfer from any Linux system can be accomplished using the scp utility to copy data to and from the DesignSafe. A file can be copied from your local system to the remote server by using the command:\n\nscp filename username@data.tacc.utexas.edu:/path/to/project/directory \n\nlocalhost$ scp test.txt siva@data.tacc.utexas.edu/corral-repl/projects/NHERI/projects/523309190170-242ac114-0001\n\nConsult the man pages for more information on scp.\n\nlocalhost$ man scp\n\nrsync\n\nThe rsync command is a reliable method to transfer files, especially if you transfer files in stages, as it compares files automatically to make sure that files in the source and destination are the same. It is recommended for users who need checksum method since it involves calculating checksum for each file to make sure that the transfer is complete and accurate.\n\nBelow is the usage of rsync command for transferring a file named \"myfile.c\" from the current location on your desktop to your project directory in the DesignSafe\n\nlocalhost$ rsync myfile.c username@data.tacc.utexas.edu:/corral-repl/projects/NHERI/projects/project_id\n\nAn entire directory can be transferred from source to destination by using rsync as well. For directory transfers the options \"-avtr\" will transfer the files recursively (\"-r\" option) along with the modification times (\"-t\" option) and in the archive mode (\"-a\" option) to preserve symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions, ownerships, etc. The \"-v\" option (verbose) increases the amount of information displayed during any transfer. The following example demonstrates the usage of the \"-avtr\" options for transferring a directory named \"Nheri\" from the current location on your desktop to DesignSafe's project area.\n\nlocalhost$ rsync -avtr Nheri \\\nusername@data.tacc.utexas.edu:/corral-repl/projects/NHERI/projects/project_id\n\nFor more rsync options and command details, run the command \"rsync -h\" or:\n\nlocalhost$ man scp\nlocalhost$ man rsync\n\n** If rsync is used as a mode of data transfer, existing data written to the staging area will be overwritten only if the contents change. Use --ignore-existing to change this behavior. If any other data transfer protocol is used, files or folders with an existing name will be overwritten.\n\nCyberduck\n\nCyberduck is an open source graphical user interface tool to accomplish large data transfers.\n\nClick on the \"Open Connection\" button in the top right corner of the Cyberduck window to open a connection configuration window (as shown below) transfer mechanism, and type in the server name \"data.tacc.utexas.edu\". Add your username and password in the spaces provided, and if the \"more options\" area is not shown click the small triangle or button to expand the window; this will allow you to enter the path to your project area so that when Cyberduck opens the connection you will immediately see your data. Then click the \"Connect\" button to open your connection.\n\nOnce connected, you can navigate through your remote file hierarchy using familiar graphical navigation techniques. You may also drag-and-drop files into and out of the Cyberduck window to transfer files to and from DesignSafe.\n\n\n\n \n\nLast update: August 15, 2017\n ","slug":"data-transfer-guide","django_ct":"cms.page","page_id":null,"id":"cms.page.852"}}

This workshop is hosted by the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Equipment Facility at the University of Texas at Austin (NHERI@UTexas).  The workshop will be held from 1 pm on Thursday, 26 October to 12 pm Friday, 27, October 2017.  The workshop will include presentations on NHERI@UTexas equipment and non-intrusive sinkhole imaging, followed by a field demonstration of a proof-of-concept 3D imaging study at a Karstic Limestone Geophysical Ground Proving (KLGGP) site in Alachua County, Florida.  During the demonstration, NHERI@UTexas equipment will be used to collect a dataset of 3-dimensional waveforms that can be processed for 3D sinkhole imaging purposes via full-waveform inversion.  Travel support is available for a number of participants. Preference will be given to those interested in submitting proposals to the Engineering for Natural Hazards (ENH) program of NSF.\nKnowledge of the low-velocity anomalies (sinkholes) is crucial for the design and the safety of existing structures, since the anomalies can cause structural damage or collapse.  Sinkhole and anomaly detection at a site usually begins with a non-destructive testing (NDT) assessment study, as NDT data can provide general subsurface conditions over a large volume of materials. The KLGGP site currently contains a number of survey lines and five PVC-cased boreholes extending to approximately 15 m.  The site is unique because the northern portion of the retention pond commonly experiences sinkhole activity, whereas the southern portion rarely experiences sinkhole activity. The KLGGP site is located outside of Newberry, Florida on State Road 26 in Alachua County.  The site is approximately 29 km from Gainesville, and approximately 150 km from Jacksonville. The northern portion of the site has been susceptible to sinkhole formation and a number of large sinkholes have formed and been repaired.  However, the southern portion has been relatively free of sinkholes and is an ideal location for characterizing karst limestone sites.\nThe NHERI@UTexas workshop on nonintrusive, 3D-imaging of sinkholes will highlight a potential use of NHERI@UTexas equipment for true 3D non-intrusive imaging of geotechnical systems using full waveform inversion.  Specifically, during the workshop, we will use the urban, mobile, hydraulic shaker named Thumper to generate dynamic vertical and horizontal loadings at the ground surface.  The waveforms recorded from this testing will be provided to all workshop participants and other interested researchers to use in full waveform inversion studies to develop 3D models of potential sinkholes and underlying soil/rock deposits.\nThose with ideas about small, proof-of-concept tests that could piggyback on the sinkhole imaging workshop in order to generate preliminary proposal data are encouraged to contact us in advance of the workshop. Please contact Farnyuh Menq (fymenq@utexas.edu), NHERI@UTexas Site Operations Manager, with any questions regarding the workshop, piggyback proof-of-concept tests, or the equipment facility.University of Texas\nExperimental Facility Workshop\n ","django_id":"1028","title":"Workshop 17-10-26 (Texas EF)","url":"https://designsafe-ci.org/learning-center/workshop-171026","text":"Sinkhole 3D-Imaging Workshop\nOctober 26-27, 2017\n\nYou are invited to attend a workshop on Nonintrusive Sinkhole 3D-Imaging Workshop in Gainesville, FL.

{"_index":"cms","_type":"modelresult","_id":"cms.page.215","_score":1,"_source":{"body":"Experimental Protocol\n The primary goal of the CWST-EF is to be an integral part of NHERI, providing access to unique large-scale experimental test facilities, expert advice on experimental design and implementation to achieve research objectives of the Users, high quality data to researchers with traceable standards, efficient scheduling and cost-effective use of the facility, upholding health and safety standards for the staff and visiting personnel.\n\nThe Experimental Protocol incorporates the Test Plan, which consists on a series of activities to be executed during the study, and its associated sequence of events. Careful and open planning of physical model testing is extremely important to accomplish the desired objectives, to comply with the schedule program, and to be cost-effective. Planning of physical model tests is a continuous process, and requires a deep understanding of the processes to be simulated as well as the techniques applied. This is part of the collective experience of the CWST-EF team, including the previous experience with NEES operations 2004-2014. With clearly identified research objectives, the scope of the experimental work can be outlined, and the associated activities, milestones and durations can be planned beforehand.\n\nExperiment design is one of the key activities of the Test Plan. The design of an experiment will follow a general protocol that has been established over time through use of the NEES Tsunami Facility 2004-2014. Because of the uniqueness of research, the experimental setup and testing procedures will need to be customized to each User. At the same time, certain aspects of the experimental design are fairly routine, and the CWST-EF will communicate these in advance to the Users. Experiment design includes the layout of the model in the facility, model construction procedures and restrictions, instrument layout, sequence of activities, and may identify or impose certain limitations or capabilities of the testing program.

Careful and open planning of physical model testing is extremely important to accomplish the desired objectives, to comply with the schedule program, and to be cost-effective. Planning of physical model tests is a continuous process, and requires a deep understanding of the processes to be simulated as well as the techniques applied. This is part of the collective experience of the CWST-EF team, including the previous experience with NEES operations 2004-2014. With clearly identified research objectives, the scope of the experimental work can be outlined, and the associated activities, milestones and durations can be planned beforehand.\n\nExperiment design is one of the key activities of the Test Plan. The design of an experiment will follow a general protocol that has been established over time through use of the NEES Tsunami Facility 2004-2014. Because of the uniqueness of research, the experimental setup and testing procedures will need to be customized to each User. At the same time, certain aspects of the experimental design are fairly routine, and the CWST-EF will communicate these in advance to the Users. Experiment design includes the layout of the model in the facility, model construction procedures and restrictions, instrument layout, sequence of activities, and may identify or impose certain limitations or capabilities of the testing program. On many occasions, numerical modelling may be used as a complement for the experimental design, where boundary and scale effects may be identified so countermeasures can be implemented, or preliminary understanding and assessment on the processes involved can be obtained to identify the location, number and typology of instruments to be deployed for a given test configuration or environmental conditions.

You will only be asked to do this one time. This step allows DesignSafe to connect to the provider of your account to determine your name, email address, etc.\n\nThe final step (which you will also only be asked on your first login) is reading and accepting the DesignSafe Acceptable Use Policy, where you will be asked to use the system for legitimate research purposes.\n\nOnce you are logged on, you can proceed to access the full functionality of both the Data Depot and Discovery Workspace.\n\nData Depot\n\nThe Data Depot is the primary data repository for DesignSafe. The web interface to the Data Depot allows you to browse, upload, download, share and annotate data stored within the repository. Users of the system are encouraged to use the Depot not only for publication of archived results, but as a working “scratch” area for their own data and work in progress. Users may easily document and publish the data associated with their research, supporting the full data lifecycle. The Data Depot hosts both public and private data associated with a project. The Data Depot hosts both public and private data associated with a project, with the following directories:\n\n\n\tMy Data: Private directory for your data\n\tMy Projects: Group access to shared directories\n\tShared with Me: Data other users shared with me\n\tBox.com: Access to my Box files for copying\n\tDropbox.com: Access to my Dropbox for copying\n\tPublished: Curated data/projects with DOI’s\n\tCommunity Data: Non-curated user-contributed data\n\n\nBrowsing, Upload, and Download\n\n \nSharing Data &amp; Collaborating\n\nThe “Share” action button is the simplest way to share data with your collaborators. When you click this action, you can type in the user ID of any other user, and the file will be shared with them. A notification will be provided when the file is successfully shared (see “Notifications” below). Files can be shared with as many users as you choose, and you will be able to control the level of access -- you can allow other users read-only access, or read/write access to any file or folder. In the near future, you will also be able to define a group of users to share with, or to create a URL or DOI you can send to other users to share your data outside of the web interface. Sharing through the web interface changes the access control list for the file throughout the Data Depot -- this means that access is granted not only in the web applications, but also through the DesignSafe Command Line and Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs).\n\nOther sharing methods will soon be supported in the Data Depot, including integration with popular cloud applications. In April 2016, Box.com integration will be added, followed soon by Dropbox, Amazon S3, Google Drive, and others. You will be able to sync files and folders within the Data Depot with your account on these cloud services, then share data through these mechanisms as well.\n\nFinding Data Shared with You\n\nWhen other users share data, you will find it, not surprisingly, in the “Shared with me” folder in the “My Data” area . This \"Shared with me\" area is organized by folders of the ID (or group/project name) of the user sharing the data with you.\n\nViewing and Editing Metadata\n\nFrom the “Actions” menu on any file you can also select “View Metadata”. This will display any user-supplied metadata associated with the file or folder. For files you upload the metadata will typically begin empty, but you can add easily add metadata tags using the \"Show/Edit Metadata\" button.  Files shared publicly will also have a richer set of metadata available. Metadata is used in search and discovery, and often used by the experimental facilities to tag files. If you wish to have other users be able to find or discover your data, cite it properly, and make you famous, you are strongly encouraged to use metadata tags.\n\nDiscovery Workspace\n\nThe Discovery Workspace allows you to analyze and perform simulations on the data in the Data Depot. The Workspace will let you do things as complicated as a storm surge simulation or an interactive data visualization session, or as simple as cutting columns out of a file.\n\n\nFigure 1. Data Depot “My Data” screenshot\n\n\nFigure 2. Upload file screenshot\n \n\nThe Data Depot provides a user interface with a familiar desktop metaphor for manipulating files. The UI for a typical “My Data” window is shown in Figure 1 above.\n\nThe “search” bar will locate files based on file names, owners, or any metadata associated with the files. Beneath the search bar, buttons are available for a number of actions -- creating folders, refreshing the screen, changing the view from a list to a grid of icons, and uploading files.\n\nThe “upload” button will open a separate form, as shown in Figure 2 above.\n\nFrom the upload window, you may select files via a traditional “file manager” browser by clicking the “choose files” button, or simply drag and drop files from your desktop into the “Drop files here” section.\n\nBelow the action button is a bar that shows your position in the directory tree. Clicking in this area will allow you to navigate back up through the tree to your root directory.\n\nBelow the directory bar is the list of files and directories. Folders can be navigated simply by clicking on the name of the folders. Clicking on the name of a file will download the file. Next to each regular file and folder is an “action menu” icon. Clicking on this icon will bring up another menu of actions you can take on files, as shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe Rename, Move, Copy, Download, Preview and Remove actions all behave as one would expect. The remaining two buttons highlight some of the unique functionality of the DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure, as described below.\n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Action button screenshot\n\n\n \nThe Workspace provides a wide catalog of applications and will allow developers and users to add applications, as well as create new applications by combining existing ones into workflows. \n\nDiscovery Workspace Applications\n\nThe Discovery Workspace currently hosts the following commonly used applications in natural hazards engineering research applications:\n\n\n\tADCIRC - storm surge modeling\n\tOpenFOAM - computational fluid dynamics\n\tOpenSees - simulating seismic response\n\tMATLAB - data analysis\n\n\nData Analysis with Discovery Workspace Applications\n\nUsers may submit jobs using each application’s own customized job parameter input form (see Figure 4). The jobs run transparently using TACC’s computing and storage resources. Job status can be monitored in the right hand panel. The job’s output is placed in the archive directory within My Data or a user-designated directory.\n\n\nFigure 4. Example job parameters for an ADCIRC run\nCommercial Applications\n\nThe DesignSafe infrastructure includes support for commercial software. While in some cases licenses can be provided by the DesignSafe project itself, not all vendors will make licenses available for large open communities at reasonable cost. To allow broad support for as many commercial applications as possible, DesignSafe has implemented a “Bring Your Own License” (BYOL) strategy, which allows users to supply their own (or their institution’s) licenses to DesignSafe to allow access to that product integrated into the DesignSafe cloud infrastructure.\n\nMATLAB\nDesignSafe (through TACC) has negotiated with Mathworks to allow MATLAB access on TACC systems for academic research. Users submit a ticket requesting MATLAB access and are granted access upon verification they will be using MATLAB for academic research.\n\n\n\nNotifications\n\nNear the upper right corner of the screen next to your name is a Notifications bubble that will have a number in it and turn blue if you have unread notifications.You can also navigate to this link designsafe-ci.org/notifications. Here you will receive Site Notifications for Discovery Workspace Applications Job Statuses and File Sharing. For Finished Jobs, there is a link to view your output, and for each job state he details can be seen by clicking the button next to Raw Message. For shared files, there is a link to that file’s directory in My Data.\n\nManaging Your Account\n\nYou can manage your account by clicking on “My account” next to your name in the upper right corner of the screen, or navigate to this link designsafe-ci.org/account/profile.\n\nAccount Profile\n\nYou may edit your personal information on this page. Please keep this information updated if you change institution, contact info, or citizenship.\n\nLogging out\n\nIt is best to logout of DesignSafe when you are finished with your work to ensure privacy of your information and to ensure no one else uses your account in violation of the user agreement. You may logout by clicking on the down arrow next to “My account” in the upper right corner of the screen. We also recommend ensuring security by closing your browser to end all authenticated sessions.\n\nChanging your password\n\nYou may change your password by clicking on Authentication in the lefthand menu, or by navigating to the following link designsafe-ci.org/account/authentication.\n\nInactive accounts\n\nTACC security policy defines an account that has not logged in for 120 days as inactive. Use the following link to reactivate your account portal.tacc.utexas.edu/password-reset.\n\nNotifications\n\nYou can manage your notifications settings for the portal and email by clicking on Notifications in the lefthand menu, or by navigating to the following link designsafe-ci.org/account/notifications/settings.\n\nHelp\n\nThe simplest mechanism to get additional help is to submit a support ticket. Users may submit a support ticket through the DesignSafe portal here: designsafe-ci.org/help. A staff member will follow up on your request. Help is also accessed via the global navigation on the left end of the navigation bar.\n\nReferences\n\n\n\tADCIRC Website\n\tOpenFOAM User Guide\n\tOpenSees Wiki\n\n\nPolicies\n\nDesignSafe users are subject to the TACC Acceptable Use Policy and the DesignSafe Terms of Use.\n\n \n\nLast update: March 9, 2016\n ","django_id":"315","title":"Workbench User Guide","url":"https://designsafe-ci.org/rw/user-guide","text":"Workbench\nUser Guide\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe DesignSafe Cyberinfrastructure provides natural hazards researchers a portal, the Research Workbench, to share natural hazards data and computational power.

The Data Depot hosts both public and private data associated with a project, with the following directories:\n\n\n\tMy Data: Private directory for your data\n\tMy Projects: Group access to shared directories\n\tShared with Me: Data other users shared with me\n\tBox.com: Access to my Box files for copying\n\tDropbox.com: Access to my Dropbox for copying\n\tPublished: Curated data/projects with DOI’s\n\tCommunity Data: Non-curated user-contributed data\n\n\nBrowsing, Upload, and Download\n\n \nSharing Data &amp; Collaborating\n\nThe “Share” action button is the simplest way to share data with your collaborators. When you click this action, you can type in the user ID of any other user, and the file will be shared with them. A notification will be provided when the file is successfully shared (see “Notifications” below). Files can be shared with as many users as you choose, and you will be able to control the level of access -- you can allow other users read-only access, or read/write access to any file or folder. In the near future, you will also be able to define a group of users to share with, or to create a URL or DOI you can send to other users to share your data outside of the web interface. Sharing through the web interface changes the access control list for the file throughout the Data Depot -- this means that access is granted not only in the web applications, but also through the DesignSafe Command Line and Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs).\n\nOther sharing methods will soon be supported in the Data Depot, including integration with popular cloud applications. In April 2016, Box.com integration will be added, followed soon by Dropbox, Amazon S3, Google Drive, and others. You will be able to sync files and folders within the Data Depot with your account on these cloud services, then share data through these mechanisms as well.\n\nFinding Data Shared with You\n\nWhen other users share data, you will find it, not surprisingly, in the “Shared with me” folder in the “My Data” area . This \"Shared with me\" area is organized by folders of the ID (or group/project name) of the user sharing the data with you.\n\nViewing and Editing Metadata\n\nFrom the “Actions” menu on any file you can also select “View Metadata”. This will display any user-supplied metadata associated with the file or folder. For files you upload the metadata will typically begin empty, but you can add easily add metadata tags using the \"Show/Edit Metadata\" button.  Files shared publicly will also have a richer set of metadata available. Metadata is used in search and discovery, and often used by the experimental facilities to tag files. If you wish to have other users be able to find or discover your data, cite it properly, and make you famous, you are strongly encouraged to use metadata tags.\n\nDiscovery Workspace\n\nThe Discovery Workspace allows you to analyze and perform simulations on the data in the Data Depot. The Workspace will let you do things as complicated as a storm surge simulation or an interactive data visualization session, or as simple as cutting columns out of a file.\n\n\nFigure 1. Data Depot “My Data” screenshot\n\n\nFigure 2. Upload file screenshot\n \n\nThe Data Depot provides a user interface with a familiar desktop metaphor for manipulating files. The UI for a typical “My Data” window is shown in Figure 1 above.\n\nThe “search” bar will locate files based on file names, owners, or any metadata associated with the files. Beneath the search bar, buttons are available for a number of actions -- creating folders, refreshing the screen, changing the view from a list to a grid of icons, and uploading files.\n\nThe “upload” button will open a separate form, as shown in Figure 2 above.\n\nFrom the upload window, you may select files via a traditional “file manager” browser by clicking the “choose files” button, or simply drag and drop files from your desktop into the “Drop files here” section.\n\nBelow the action button is a bar that shows your position in the directory tree. Clicking in this area will allow you to navigate back up through the tree to your root directory.\n\nBelow the directory bar is the list of files and directories. Folders can be navigated simply by clicking on the name of the folders. Clicking on the name of a file will download the file. Next to each regular file and folder is an “action menu” icon. Clicking on this icon will bring up another menu of actions you can take on files, as shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe Rename, Move, Copy, Download, Preview and Remove actions all behave as one would expect. The remaining two buttons highlight some of the unique functionality of the DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure, as described below.\n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Action button screenshot\n\n\n \nThe Workspace provides a wide catalog of applications and will allow developers and users to add applications, as well as create new applications by combining existing ones into workflows. \n\nDiscovery Workspace Applications\n\nThe Discovery Workspace currently hosts the following commonly used applications in natural hazards engineering research applications:\n\n\n\tADCIRC - storm surge modeling\n\tOpenFOAM - computational fluid dynamics\n\tOpenSees - simulating seismic response\n\tMATLAB - data analysis\n\n\nData Analysis with Discovery Workspace Applications\n\nUsers may submit jobs using each application’s own customized job parameter input form (see Figure 4). The jobs run transparently using TACC’s computing and storage resources. Job status can be monitored in the right hand panel. The job’s output is placed in the archive directory within My Data or a user-designated directory.\n\n\nFigure 4. Example job parameters for an ADCIRC run\nCommercial Applications\n\nThe DesignSafe infrastructure includes support for commercial software. While in some cases licenses can be provided by the DesignSafe project itself, not all vendors will make licenses available for large open communities at reasonable cost. To allow broad support for as many commercial applications as possible, DesignSafe has implemented a “Bring Your Own License” (BYOL) strategy, which allows users to supply their own (or their institution’s) licenses to DesignSafe to allow access to that product integrated into the DesignSafe cloud infrastructure.\n\nMATLAB\nDesignSafe (through TACC) has negotiated with Mathworks to allow MATLAB access on TACC systems for academic research. Users submit a ticket requesting MATLAB access and are granted access upon verification they will be using MATLAB for academic research.\n\n\n\nNotifications\n\nNear the upper right corner of the screen next to your name is a Notifications bubble that will have a number in it and turn blue if you have unread notifications.You can also navigate to this link designsafe-ci.org/notifications. Here you will receive Site Notifications for Discovery Workspace Applications Job Statuses and File Sharing. For Finished Jobs, there is a link to view your output, and for each job state he details can be seen by clicking the button next to Raw Message. For shared files, there is a link to that file’s directory in My Data.\n\nManaging Your Account\n\nYou can manage your account by clicking on “My account” next to your name in the upper right corner of the screen, or navigate to this link designsafe-ci.org/account/profile.\n\nAccount Profile\n\nYou may edit your personal information on this page. Please keep this information updated if you change institution, contact info, or citizenship.\n\nLogging out\n\nIt is best to logout of DesignSafe when you are finished with your work to ensure privacy of your information and to ensure no one else uses your account in violation of the user agreement. You may logout by clicking on the down arrow next to “My account” in the upper right corner of the screen. We also recommend ensuring security by closing your browser to end all authenticated sessions.\n\nChanging your password\n\nYou may change your password by clicking on Authentication in the lefthand menu, or by navigating to the following link designsafe-ci.org/account/authentication.\n\nInactive accounts\n\nTACC security policy defines an account that has not logged in for 120 days as inactive. Use the following link to reactivate your account portal.tacc.utexas.edu/password-reset.\n\nNotifications\n\nYou can manage your notifications settings for the portal and email by clicking on Notifications in the lefthand menu, or by navigating to the following link designsafe-ci.org/account/notifications/settings.\n\nHelp\n\nThe simplest mechanism to get additional help is to submit a support ticket. Users may submit a support ticket through the DesignSafe portal here: designsafe-ci.org/help. A staff member will follow up on your request. Help is also accessed via the global navigation on the left end of the navigation bar.\n\nReferences\n\n\n\tADCIRC Website\n\tOpenFOAM User Guide\n\tOpenSees Wiki\n\n\nPolicies\n\nDesignSafe users are subject to the TACC Acceptable Use Policy and the DesignSafe Terms of Use.\n\n \n\nLast update: March 9, 2016\n ","slug":"user-guide","django_ct":"cms.page","page_id":null,"id":"cms.page.315"}}

This workshop is hosted by the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Equipment Facility at the University of Texas at Austin (NHERI@UTexas).  The workshop will be held from 8 AM – 3:00 PM on Friday, 11 November 2016.  The workshop will include presentations on NHERI@UTexas equipment and non-intrusive levee imaging, followed by a field demonstration of a proof-of-concept 3D imaging study on the Mel-Price Wood River levee.  During the demonstration, NHERI@UTexas equipment will be used to collect a dataset of 3-component, 3-dimensional waveforms that can be processed for 3D levee imaging purposes via full-waveform inversion.  Travel support is available for a number of participants. Preference will be given to those interested in submitting proposals to the Engineering for Natural Hazards (ENH) program of NSF. \nMuch of the Mel-Price Wood River levee is a sand core/clay cap levee, which sits on top of a relatively thin clay blanket underlain by a sand aquifer. During flooding events, underseepage through the sand foundation soils causes high hydraulic gradients under the levee and sand boils to develop on the dry side.  Extensive characterization of the levee and foundation soils has been completed, including over 50 CPTs, over 100 borings/SPT, 100s of hand probes, and numerous pump tests. Foundation soil testing has revealed a heterogeneous mixture of sands/gravelly sands, including seams of silts, and at deeper depths, some cobbles and boulders. A number of relief wells were originally installed to prevent piping under the levee. However, these were not completely effective at eliminating sand boils during large flooding events. A number of alternatives, including a seepage cut-off wall, seepage berms, and pressure relief wells have been considered. Through a risk analysis, pressure relief wells were determined to be the most efficient and effective alternative and designs for this remediation are currently being generated. Further understanding of the overall condition/integrity of the levee, as well as the location(s) of the high and low permeability seams beneath the levee would aid in the design of the relief wells to effectively limit piping under the levee during flooding events.  In an attempt to provide better 2D imaging of the levee, both pseudo 2D MASW and resistivity surveys were recently conducted by Dr. Wood and Dr. Bernhardt along the crest and on either side of the levee (dry and wet sides) for approximately a 4-km section.  It is desirable to compare the results from a true 3D imaging survey with those developed using pseudo 2D methods.\nThe NHERI@UTexas Levee Imaging Workshop will highlight a potential use of NHERI@UTexas equipment for true 3D non-intrusive imaging of geotechnical systems via full waveform inversion.  Specifically, during the workshop, we will use the urban, mobile, hydraulic shaker Thumper to generate small-strain dynamic vertical and horizontal loading on the ground surface at many locations on the crest and toe(s) of the levee.  The response of the levee will be recorded using a combination of hundreds of vertical and three-component geophones deployed in a dense grid over the crest, slopes and toes of the levee.  The waveforms recorded from this testing will be provided to all workshop participants and other interested researchers to use in full waveform inversion studies to develop 3D models of the levee and underlying soil deposits.\nThose with ideas about small, proof-of-concept tests that could piggyback on the levee imaging workshop in order to generate preliminary proposal data are encouraged to contact us in advance of the workshop.

{"_index":"cms","_type":"modelresult","_id":"cms.page.856","_score":1,"_source":{"body":"A Case for Jupyter and DesignSafe\n\nPublished on May 15, 2017\n \n\n\n \n\nScott Brandenberg, associate professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California Los Angeles, is a new user of Jupyter notebooks. In a recent interview with the Texas Advanced Computing Center, which hosts the NHERI DesignSafe-CI, Brandenburg shared his experiences as a new user of Jupyter notebooks.\n\nBrandenburg’s research specialties are geotechnical earthquake engineering, water distribution, and seismic effects on underground structures. He conducts experiments at the NHERI Centrifuge Experimental Facility at the UC Davis Center for Geotechnical Modeling.\n\n \n\nWhat is the nature of the research for which you're using the Jupyter notebooks?\n\nScott Brandenberg: The topic of the research project for which we've developed a Jupyter notebook is seismic effects on underground structures. The project looks at the development of earth pressures during earthquakes. One of the key problems that engineers have to solve when designing underground structures is how much pressure the soil exerts on the structure when there's an earthquake. As an earthquake is occurring, the ground shakes and there can be increases in pressure on an underground structure caused by the earthquake waves interacting with the structure, such as a culvert or tunnel.\n\nOne of the big areas that building owners are struggling with is that the approach engineers are currently using to compute these earth pressures is not particularly realistic, and they're tending to over predict these pressures. What we're doing is developing new analytical methods that are more realistic and are based on more fundamental theory than the current methods. We ran centrifuge experiments on underground structures to generate seismic earth pressure data that is being used to evaluate our new theory as well as the existing methods. We hope that the new method will do a better job of explaining the observations during these experiments.\n\n \n\nWhat do you find most appealing about DesignSafe?\n\nScott Brandenberg: I'm going to compare DesignSafe with NEES because I'm focused on the improvements that have happened. NEES developed a data repository. That meant that when we completed an experiment we'd archive the data and metadata (that describes the data) like Excel tables and sensor lists. Then, the data would be in NEES for other people to download and use. However, we wouldn't use the data within the NEES data repository; we'd go to the repository to download the data and then be operating on our own local instance of the data. Uploading the data to NEES was therefore an extra step that had to be undertaken by the project team, and did not directly facilitate discovery of new findings from the data.\n\nWhat I really like about DesignSafe is that it's changing that paradigm. Now we're able to analyze the data within the DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure itself. We upload the data, we can operate on the data there, and we can share the tools for analyzing data. One thing that tended to happen with NEES is that I would supervise a PhD student who ran the experiments. They would write their own scripts to process the data. We'd write papers; submit them; and then the student would graduate and take all of their scripts with them. I'd have access to the data but not all of the processing files. DesignSafe is going to solve that problem. We're going to work on scripts in the cloud and everyone will have access to them. When a student is finished with a project, all of the work that they've done will be archived in DesignSafe. Their whole workflow will be documented and available for further reuse. That's a really attractive feature to me as a PI for a lot of these projects.\n\n \n\nWhat is your own description of a Jupyter notebook?\n\n\n Scott Brandenberg is an Associate Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).\n\n\nScott Brandenberg: It's a powerful tool. I think it's going to change the way that people in the hazard community work with data. The Jupyter notebook is a program that allows you to integrate a variety of different coding languages – Python or R, for example – within an active document that runs on the web. The Jupyter notebooks enable us to have code blocks that are actually operating on data. And those are combined with markdown cells that provide explanations of what's happening. It's a good way of synthesizing the calculations with the explanation. It makes it easier to go back and figure out what was happening and what workflow was used. The Jupyter notebooks can run in the cloud in DesignSafe, which means we can be operating on the data that we've collected and put it into DesignSafe without having to download it onto our own local computer first. That's really nice because that means that a student can work on a script, and let me know that they made some changes. Then I can log in and take a look at their Jupyter notebook and add new changes or comments myself. I've been using other calculation tools for about 20 years, so the notebooks are fairly new to me. It was the first time that I'd ever used Python, for example.\n\n \n\nWhat are some of the ways your research was done prior to using the Jupyter notebooks?\n\nScott Brandenberg: I think that the most common approach used by researchers was that students would have data on their own computer and would use tools like MATLAB or Mathcad to process that data and publish those results. The data might be shared but the scripts were not shared, or if they were shared they were linked to the particular directories in which the students stored the data and therefore were not easily transferrable. Experimental data researchers would also write \"data reports\", written documentation about the dataset. The data report was critical for other researchers to understand how to use the dataset (which column corresponds to which sensor, for example). Usually those data reports would be .pdf files that users would download. And they would include hundreds of pages of data plots. What we've done with our culvert project is to make an interactive digital data report in DesignSafe using a Jupyter notebook. Because the Jupyter notebook uses markdown language we were able to take all of the text that would usually appear in the .pdf file, format it as html, and put it in the notebook.\n\n \n\nHow is the data shared and distributed?\n\nScott Brandenberg: Users can interact with the data using the Jupyter notebook, but they can also download the data outside of Jupyter, too. We upload data files and we decide when we want to make the data public; once it's public anyone can log into DesignSafe and access those data files. So they could go to Jupyter and look at the data using that tool or they could directly download the data for their own use. Or they could even develop their own Jupyter notebook in DesignSafe and process the data there. Also, they could simulate the experiment using a finite element a program like OpenSEES, and write a Jupyter notebook that compares the results from the computer simulation with the experimental data.\n\n \n\nHow do you access the Jupyter notebooks?\n\nScott Brandenberg: In general, you access the Jupyter notebooks through DesignSafe. If you log into DesignSafe, you'll see the Research Workbench area which includes the Data Depot. That's where you go to access published data, as well as your own private project data. DesignSafe also includes the Discovery Workspace, which includes tools, such as Jupyter, that can access the data in the Data Depot. To open Jupyter in DesignSafe — you just click a button within the Discovery Workspace, it opens right in your web browser, and then you can open a Jupyter notebook from a directory in the Data Depot. In addition, the Jupyter notebooks are open source so you can download the client and run it locally on your computer.\n\nMy Jupyter notebook is available to everyone in the Community Data directory: \n\n \n\nWhat are the primary benefits of Jupyter notebooks?\n\nScott Brandenberg: The main benefit I can see for other PIs is that all of your student's scripts are available for everyone in the project. Everything that the students are working on is all there to share, which is better than having the students work locally on their own computer. There will always be users who are reluctant to adopt a new technology. The way Python works is similar to MATLAB, so the leap is not that big, and our research team has adapted pretty easily.\n\n \n\nFinally, how do you think the notebooks are helping to advance your research?\n\nScott Brandenberg: The Jupyter notebooks are not directly providing new computational methods or scripts that we didn't have before. The real benefit is having the same processes together in the same workflow, so the data is there and the processing scripts are there with it in the cloud. I think that's the real innovation. It's more about the quality of the workflow and having everything well documented in one place. I think it does have capabilities to fundamentally change how we're doing our work.\n\nFor example, I'm part of another effort right now that's using DesignSafe to build a large database of field case histories from liquefaction events that have happened all over the world. There's going to be quite a bit of data — more data than any single user would want to download and try to process on their own computer. The Jupyter notebooks are providing us with the ability to operate on all of that data within DesignSafe so we don't have to download it. It has big impact when we're analyzing a lot of data at the same time. We'll be able to use these cloud resources to do things that we weren't able to do before.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOriginally published on April 28, 2017 by Faith Singer-Villalobos\nat the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).\n\nRelated Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","django_id":"856","title":"A Case for Jupyter Notebook and DesignSafe","url":"https://designsafe-ci.org/community/news/2017/case-jupyter-notebook-and-designsafe","text":"A Case for Jupyter and DesignSafe\n\nPublished on May 15, 2017\n \n\n\n \n\nScott Brandenberg, associate professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California Los Angeles, is a new user of Jupyter notebooks.

This workshop is hosted by the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure Equipment Facility at the University of Texas at Austin (NHERI@UTexas).  The workshop will be held from approximately 1pm on Thursday, August 3, 2017 to noon on Friday, August 4, 2017.  The workshop will include presentations on NHERI@UTexas equipment and in-situ, non-destructive dynamic structural testing on Thursday at Rutgers University. On Friday morning, a field demonstration of dynamic structural testing will be held on an overpass bridge on I-195 near Trenton, NJ. Transportation will be provided to the field demonstration location.  During the field demonstration on Friday, the NHERI@UTexas shaker, T-Rex, will be used to dynamically excite the bridge, and sensors provided by NHERI@UTexas and Rutgers University will be used to collect a dataset of soil-foundation-structure system responses. Travel support is available for a number of participants. Preference will be given to those interested in submitting proposals to the Engineering for Natural Hazards (ENH) program of NSF. For those who are interested but are unable to attend the workshop in person, the presentations made on Thursday will be webcast on DesignSafe. \n\nHotel information will be sent to registered participants. Hotel room reservations must be made by July 12th to obtain the group rate for the workshop.\n\nThis workshop is being held in conjunction with dynamic bridge testing being done as part of an ongoing NSF-funded project titled, “EAGER: Informing Infrastructure Decisions through Large-Amplitude Forced Vibration Testing” (CMMI-1650170, Project PI: Nenad Gucunski). Special thanks to our colleagues at Rutgers University, Nenad Gucunski and Franklin Moon, for helping organize the workshop and allowing the NHERI community to observe and learn from their experiences using NHERI@UTexas equipment for in-situ dynamic structural testing.\n\nThe NHERI@UTexas Structural Testing Workshop will highlight a potential use of NHERI@UTexas equipment for non-destructive, in-situ testing of soil-foundation-structure systems.  Specifically, during the workshop, we will use the mobile, triaxial hydraulic shaker, T-Rex, to generate small-strain dynamic loading on the bridge deck.  The response of the bridge superstructure, substructure, and surrounding soil will be recorded using an array of three-component geophones.  The bridge being tested is a two-span, continuous steel girder bridge with multi-pier reinforced concrete bents and spread footing foundations. Data collected from the workshop demonstration will be provided to workshop participants and other interested researchers for use in development of future proposals.\n\nThose with ideas about small, proof-of-concept tests that could piggyback on the bridge testing workshop in order to generate preliminary proposal data are encouraged to contact us in advance of the workshop.

While the web interface in the DesignSafe portal is easy for moving small numbers of modest size files, if you need to move large volumes of data, large numbers of files (&gt; 50) or move folders, the Globus tools are the recommended way of moving data in and out of DesignSafe.\n\nGlobus supplies high speed, reliable, asynchronous transfers to DesignSafe. Globus is fast, for large volumes of data, as it uses multiple network sockets simultaneously to transfer data. It is reliable for large numbers of directories and files, as it can automatically fail and restart itself, and will only notify you when the transfers are completed successfully. \n\nOf course, to get these benefits, there are a few setup steps you have to do beyond the normal Data Depot transfer process. Most of the steps you are only required to do once when you set up Globus to use for the first time. Several steps will need to be repeated each time you set up a new computer to use Globus for DesignSafe. Once you are set up, you can use Globus not only for transfers to and from DesignSafe, but also to access other cyberinfrastructure resources at TACC and around the world.\n\nTo start using Globus, you need to do three things: Enable Globus for your DesignSafe account, generate a unique identifier for all Globus services, and enroll the machine you are transferring data to/from with Globus (this can be your personal laptop or desktop, or a server to which you have access). Follow this one-time process to set up the Globus file transfer capability.\n\nStep 1: Submit a ticket to activate Globus access for your DesignSafe/TACC account\n\nStep 2: Retrieve a Distinguished Name (DN) and add it to your DesignSafe/TACC account\n\nStep 3: Activate your desktop/laptop as a Globus Endpoint and transfer files\n\n\nStep 1: Submit a ticket to activate Globus access for your DesignSafe/TACC Account\n\nUse the DesignSafe Help feature to request Globus access for your account. Simply submit a ticket here:  https://designsafe-ci.org/help and in the body of the message say you wish to use Globus.  You will get a response via email when this is complete. \n\n\nStep 2: Retrieve and Associate a DN to your DesignSafe/TACC Account\n\nIn order for Globus to know who you are when you move data in and out of DesignSafe from your computer, or between any other pair of systems, Globus needs a unique identifier for you, which is called a “Distinguished Name”, or DN. You can generate a DN instantly for free. To create a DN, you need to log in from some authoritative source that can verify your identity, typically your university or employer. If you already have a DN from another source, you can use that. If you do not, you can associate one with your account from many of the major universities in the world via the “CI Logon” service. \n\nTo retrieve your DN, go to https://cilogon.org in your browser. Select an Identity Provider from the drop-down list, and click \"Log On\" which will take you to the login screen for the Identity Provider you selected. If your university or employer is not in the list, please file a ticket using the process in Step 1.\n\n\n\nAfter successfully authenticating at your chosen Identity Provider, you are redirected back to CILogon, where you can find your Certificate Subject that you will need to copy and paste in the next step:\n\n/DC=org/DC=cilogon/C=US/O=University of Texas at Austin/CN=Sample Person A00000\n\nLogin to the TACC User Portal https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu and select \"Account Profile\" from the main menu under the \"Home\" dropdown.\n\n\n\nOn the left of the page is a list of account actions, select \"Manage DNs\". You will be presented with a list of the DNs currently associated with your TACC account and a text field to associate a new DN to your account. Enter the Certificate Subject obtained from CILogon.org in the text field. Click the button to \"Associate DN\". This will associate the new DN with your account. Please note, it may take up to 30 minutes for this change to propagate to all TACC systems.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Activate Your Desktop/Laptop as a Globus Endpoint and Transfer Files\n\nNow that you have associated the DN with your TACC account and given the DN time to propagate to the systems (up to thirty minutes), you can activate the Globus transfer endpoints and begin transferring files.\n\nGo to https://globus.org and log in.\n\n\n\nUpon successful login you, you will be directed to the \"Manage Data\" landing page.\n\n\n\nCheck on Endpoints.\n\n\n\nClick “+ Globus Connect Personal endpoint” and follow the instructions to set up your desktop/laptop as an endpoint.\n\n\n\nEnter a Display Name to identify your local endpoint like My Laptop, My Desktop at Home etc. and then click Generate Setup Key and click copy to copy the Personal Setup Key.\n\nDownload and Install the Globus Connect Personal client.\n\nAfter install, open the Globus Connect Personal application.

The post was shared with the National Advisory Committee for the National Wind Storm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP).\n  \n  Dawson also was interviewed on a special “Harvey” edition of the DesignSafe Radio podcast, where he discussed prediction models and potential damage. On another special DSR podcast, Prof. Brian Phillips of the University of Florida discussed measuring hurricane wind speeds.\n  \n  Just before Hurricane Harvey made landfall, UF researcher Forrest Masters led a reconnaissance team to Rockport, Texas, 30 miles north of Corpus Christi, to gather hurricane data. His team successfully deployed two 50 ft. weather stations – each equipped with five precision ultrasonic anemometers – to capture synchronized, high-fidelity (10 Hz) data in the most extreme winds that cause damage. Masters is the principal investigator for the NHERI experimental facility at the University of Florida.\n  \n  Reconnaissance teams funded by the National Science Foundation are being coordinated through the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association. Prof. Ellen Rathje is coordinating the geotechnical response teams, and Prof. Tracy Kijewski-Correa is coordinating the structural response teams. \n  \n  Prof. Nina Stark of Virginia Tech is leading a geotechnical reconnaissance team to investigate the coast from Port Aransas to Galveston. Mr. Lee Wooten from GEI Consultants is leading a second geotechnical reconnaissance team to investigate the flooding effects in Houston.\n  \n  Multiple structural engineering reconnaissance teams are deploying to document the damage to buildings and other civil infrastructure through a range of ground and aerial techniques, radiating east along the coast as well as inland from Port Aransas/Rockport. These teams are dynamically reconfiguring as needed to respond to the U.S. landfall of Hurricane Irma.\n  \n  Engineer Peter Vickery, a member of the NHERI Independent Advisory Council, has prepared a preliminary map of estimated wind speeds; it is posted in the DesignSafe Reconnaissance Portal.

The post was shared with the National Advisory Committee for the National Wind Storm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP).\n  \n  Dawson also was interviewed on a special “Harvey” edition of the DesignSafe Radio podcast, where he discussed prediction models and potential damage. On another special DSR podcast, Prof. Brian Phillips of the University of Florida discussed measuring hurricane wind speeds.\n  \n  Just before Hurricane Harvey made landfall, UF researcher Forrest Masters led a reconnaissance team to Rockport, Texas, 30 miles north of Corpus Christi, to gather hurricane data. His team successfully deployed two 50 ft. weather stations – each equipped with five precision ultrasonic anemometers – to capture synchronized, high-fidelity (10 Hz) data in the most extreme winds that cause damage. Masters is the principal investigator for the NHERI experimental facility at the University of Florida.\n  \n  Reconnaissance teams funded by the National Science Foundation are being coordinated through the Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association. Prof. Ellen Rathje is coordinating the geotechnical response teams, and Prof. Tracy Kijewski-Correa is coordinating the structural response teams. \n  \n  Prof. Nina Stark of Virginia Tech is leading a geotechnical reconnaissance team to investigate the coast from Port Aransas to Galveston. Mr. Lee Wooten from GEI Consultants is leading a second geotechnical reconnaissance team to investigate the flooding effects in Houston.\n  \n  Multiple structural engineering reconnaissance teams are deploying to document the damage to buildings and other civil infrastructure through a range of ground and aerial techniques, radiating east along the coast as well as inland from Port Aransas/Rockport. These teams are dynamically reconfiguring as needed to respond to the U.S. landfall of Hurricane Irma.\n  \n  Engineer Peter Vickery, a member of the NHERI Independent Advisory Council, has prepared a preliminary map of estimated wind speeds; it is posted in the DesignSafe Reconnaissance Portal. The data collected by the University of Florida was one of the data sets used to generate the map.  \n  \n  Architect Tom Smith, NHERI Network Coordination Office member and FEMA subcontractor, led a wind pre-mitigation assessment team that was deployed to the Gulf Coast region.

In order to estimate the seismic risk to the vertical dry casks, the response of the structure to seismic loads and associated impact scenarios needs to be studied. Among various tasks required for the risk analysis, the focus of this talk is on the cask structural response to the seismic and tip-over loads and the associated numerical simulation of the problems in a commercial finite element program.\nVirtual experiments are designed in both tasks by generating different cask-pad-soil configurations across typical ranges of structural, geometric, and material properties. Nonlinear time history response of the generated configurations subjected to seismic/impact loads is obtained by using validated 3D finite element models, and key structural responses are estimated. Employing stepwise regression, probabilistic seismic demand models are proposed for the maximum horizontal displacement and maximum rocking angle of the casks subjected to seismic loads, and metamodels are developed to predict the maximum strain of the canister and maximum acceleration of the concrete overpack in the tip-over scenario.

However, this spring 31 students from St. Stephens Episcopal School in Austin, Texas, got an up-close look at the importance of engineering through an earthquake simulation activity.\n\nAfter completing an earthquake unit in their engineering class, the nine juniors and 22 seniors constructed balsa wood towers and brought them to the Ferguson Structural Engineering Lab (FSEL) at The University of Texas (UT) for a structural design challenge. After touring the large-scale structural testing facilities of FSEL, the high school students visited the NHERI@UTexas facility next door, which houses large, one-of-a-kind shaker trucks that are used to study the seismic performance of soils, foundations, and structures world-wide.\n\nThe NHERI@UTexas facility is part of the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI), which includes a collection of seven experimental facilities that provide the natural hazards research community with access to unique testing capabilities. Funded by NSF, NHERI also includes the DesignSafe Cyberinfrastructure, a cloud-based environment for data sharing and high performance computing to support research in natural hazards engineering.\n\nAs part of the DesignSafe plans for education and outreach, the activity has contributed to the development of curriculum in natural hazards. “We want to inspire students to study natural hazards engineering by showing them that this field of study integrates high-tech computation and experimentation to ultimately save lives,” said Ellen Rathje a civil engineering professor at UT and principal investigator of the project.\n\nThe day of the competition was filled with the sound of crashing wood and laughter. Led by Patricia Clayton, assistant professor in the UT Department of Civil, Architectural, and Environmental Engineering, students tested the strength of their models using an educational shake table.\n\nShake tables are tools that can replicate seismic ground motions collected from historic earthquakes. After adding weights to the models to mirror the mass of actual buildings, the models were subjected to three earthquakes, each increasing in intensity — the 1994 Northridge, California earthquake, the 1940 El Centro, California earthquake, and the 1995 Great Hanshin, Japan earthquake.\n\nSeveral models survived the first three tests and were then subjected to an adjustable sine wave, which shook the models with increasing intensity until they reached their final breaking point.\n\n“Students got a sense for how engineering for natural hazards, such as earthquakes, can really impact people. When you see a model that totally collapses, you think wow, that could be a real building that collapses during an earthquake and kills many people,” Clayton said.\n\nParticipants in the program agreed. “This experience helped me better understand the impact that natural disasters can cause,” said Jennifer Jou, a junior and aspiring mechanical engineer. “I also realized the safe houses and apartments we now live in are based on the efforts of the civil engineers around the world.”\n\nThe competition also provided the opportunity for the Texas Advanced Computing Center’s Education and Outreach group to test their new accelerometer design.

The University of Washington (UW) is now home to the Rapid Response Research Facility (RAPID) that will help ensure that as much of this precious data as possible is not lost.\n\n\"Often with rescue and response efforts, this very valuable data disappears really quickly,\" Joe Wartman, the director of the facility and a UW associate professor of civil and environmental engineering said. \"By collecting this data in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, we can begin to understand what went wrong and why. This allows us to better prepare and take precautionary measures in advance of future events.\"\n\nThe UW RAPID Facility is funded by a $4.1 million investment from the National Science Foundation’s Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) grant. The facility will provide the tools to help quickly collect and assess critical post-disaster data.\n\nThe data collected post-disaster will help engineers and builders to better prepare for their structures to survive future disasters.\n\nThe RAPID team will focus on two types of natural hazards: wind hazards, such as tornados and coastal storms; and earthquakes, including ground failure and tsunamis.  The team will utilize next-generation tools including drones and laser scanning equipment. Additionally mobile devices for social surveys and mixed-media recording, seismic instruments, and sensors that are capable of measuring data at the centimeter scale will be available to the team.\n\nNew software tools capable of transmitting, integrating, exploring, and visualizing the data sets will be created at the RAPID Facility.

At Florida International University (FIU) research is being conducted to help tackle these very problems. Arindam Chowdhury, director of the Laboratory of Wind Engineering Research at FIU, is working with the Wall of Wind facility to find solutions to these challenges. Chowdury says there are numerous problems that a storm like Hurricane Matthew can bring to coastal societies.\n\n“One thing would definitely be the wind impact,” Chowdhury said. “So we need to come up with solutions to reduce the wind load. Another problem is the effect of the wind on power outages. That’s a societal problem.”\n\nTo help gain a better understanding of how to reduce the impact such storms can have, researchers at the FIU facilities are employing holistic testing(testing that takes into account how all the parts of a structure work together and react when under stress). Component testing (testing focusing on one component of a structure/infrastructure) can miss many of the potential problems that holistic testing is able to identify.\n\n“Component research does not give you all of the information,” Chowdury said. “They are simplistic tests that are done because there is no other facility that can do the holistic testing we can.”\n\nChowdury noted that one problem that occurs frequently during natural disaters is cascading failures. When one system fails, the pressure from the damages is transferred to the other systems. This can set off a domino effect of failures. Only with holistic testing can researchers properly identify the potential for cascading failures in a structure.\n\n“Many components that can pass a component level test may fail in a system level tests,” Chowdury said. “Now you are testing it with modern infrastructure in place. For example, you can test a small section of roof tiles but that doesn’t give you all the information. By testing a full-scale model of a building you get the effects on the whole system. One system failing can redistribute the load to the other systems. Look at roof tiles for example. When one goes the other tiles must take up the load. If you can prevent the failure of the first tile then perhaps you can save the whole roof.”\n\nThe Wall of Wind facility is also being used to look into how to reduce the impact of storm surges.\n\n“Storm surges and flooding are another big issue that coastal communities face,” Chowdhury said. “There has been some research on how to use vegetation, barriers, wave breakers and even off shore wind turbines to reduce storm flooding.”\n\nBy reducing storm surges and flooding, much of the recent damage caused by Hurricane Matthew could be prevented in the future. Storm surges occur when the sea level rises from the pressure and wind effects associated with storms. When sea levels raise it can be devastating for the people that live on the coastlines.\n\n“Houses along the coastlines of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina were recently covered in water during Hurricane Matthew,” Chowdury said. “The structures may not have been damaged but everything inside is gone. The goal is to find a way to reduce the damage storm surges cause.”\n\nChowdury hopes that all of the research being conducted at FIU and at other Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure  (NHERI) facilities will be of benefit to coastal societies in future storms.\n\n“The co-operation between these various NHERI facilities can be used to cover pretty much everything that we saw in (Hurricane) Matthew,” Chowdury said. “Everything we (NHERI) are doing as a whole will help improve coastal societies.”\n \n\n\n\nNovember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ","django_id":"632","title":"FIU Looks at the Big Picture","url":"https://designsafe-ci.org/community/news/2016/fiu-looks-big-picture","text":"FIU Looks at the Big Picture\n\nPublished on November 2, 2016\nJordan Moss, UTSA College of Engineering\n\n\n\n \n\nWith the recent damage caused by Hurricane Matthew along the east coast it is important to understand how to reduce societal damages during such events.

{"_index":"cms","_type":"modelresult","_id":"cms.page.644","_score":1,"_source":{"body":"HPC &amp; Storage\nAllocations Policy\n\nIntroduction\n\nDesignSafe is a comprehensive cloud-based natural hazards research environment for experimental, theoretical, and computational engineering and science, providing a place to steward data from its creation through publication and archive, and also the workspace in which to understand, analyze, collaborate and publish that data, provided through funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The allocation policy for DesignSafe considers that users may have a range of use cases, ranging from short term analysis work to long term data storage, for very large or very small experiments. New use cases for DesignSafe may emerge—please don’t hesitate to contact the project team if you feel you have special circumstances not covered by this document. This document defines the policies governing allocations for compute time and storage on the DesignSafe platform. All registered users are provided a Base Allocation, as described below, and may request an additional Allocation for various purposes.\n\nWho is eligible for an Account?\n\nDesignSafe is broadly available to any researcher or practitioner working in open Natural Hazards Engineering research. By “open,” the expectation is that any research performed on DesignSafe is unclassified, and will result in publication in a broadly available journal or conference.\n\nWho is eligible for Allocations?\n\nA Base Allocation on DesignSafe is provided to all registered users. An additional Allocation on DesignSafe is headed by a project PI, typically a faculty member or researcher scientist at a US-based academic institution (private sector users are also welcome, see below). The PI may then add additional investigators, including students to their allocation at their discretion. PIs are responsible for insuring that any users added to their allocation comply with the terms and conditions for use of the DesignSafe resource. Collaborative projects involving non-U.S. researchers are encouraged as long as they include substantive intellectual participation by the U.S. researchers. In joint research projects, foreign collaborators are eligible to make use of that allocation in a manner consistent with the request.While a PI is typically a faculty member or researcher at an academic institution, there are a number of other cases where an individual may be eligible to be a PI:\n\n\n\tNSF Graduate Student Researcher Fellows: While in most cases, a graduate student is ineligible to be PI of an allocation request, an exception is made for NSF Graduate Student Fellows. Recipients of these NSF awards can submit requests for Startup allocations. Include supporting documentation (grant number or an award letter) as part of the request submission.\n\tOther federal agencies: Research staff employed by federal agencies or non-NSF FFRDCs are eligible to apply for an allocation if their agency or center does not typically provide research staff with access to resources of adequate scope for the planned research.\n\tState educational offices or organizations and local school districts may submit allocation requests intended to broaden the impact, accelerate the pace, and increase the effectiveness of improvements in science, mathematics, and engineering education in both K-12 and post-secondary levels. A teacher or educator at an accredited public or private K-12 school is eligible to apply for an allocation as PI.\n\tIndependent museums, observatories, libraries, research laboratories, professional societies and similar organizations in the United States that are directly associated with educational or research activities are eligible.\n\tU.S. commercial organizations, especially small businesses with strong capabilities in scientific or engineering research or education may apply for an allocation. The DesignSafe Project is interested in supporting projects that couple industrial research resources and perspectives with those of universities; therefore, it especially welcomes requests from cooperative projects involving both universities and the private commercial sector. It is necessary for these projects to submit their work in an open forum, and make the work readily available to the public.\n\n\nWhat are the units of an allocation and how am I charged?\n\nDesignSafe provides access to a variety of cloud-based computing and storage resources, accessible through several different interfaces (see the User Guide for an overview). A Base Allocation of compute time and storage is automatically provided to each user at the time they create an account. Users can request additional Allocations of computation time or data storage. Compute time is allocated in Service Units (SUs), which equates to one hour of wall clock time on a single processor core of time used. Compute time is charged on computations run through the Discovery Workspace via the web interface or through direct command line access to systems provided through DesignSafe. Storage is allocated and charged by the gigabyte-year, a gigabyte of physical storage for a one year time period.\n\nAdditional Service Unit Charges for Advanced Reservations\n\nThe basic principle for charging service units for DesignSafe resources is to evaluate the amount of time a fraction of the resource is unavailable to other users. If a reservation is made through the portal for a particular date/time in the future, the user will be charged for this time regardless of whether the reservation is actually used, as the DesignSafe scheduling system will have to drain the appropriate part of the system to satisfy the reservation, even if the nodes requested are not actually used.\n\nHow do I apply for an Additional Allocation?\n\nAdditional allocations may be requested via the DesignSafe Portal by submitting a . An application for an additional allocation includes information about the eligibility of the requestor, a description of the research to be performed and its sources of support, and a justification for the number of SUs requested.\n\nAllocation Sizes and Limits\n\nThere are four types of allocations available on DesignSafe:\n\n\n\tBase Allocation – Automatically issued to each user when their account is created. A Base Allocation provides up to 8,000 SUs and 50 gigabytes of storage. This is roughly equivalent to the use of a single processor core for one year.\n\tStartup Allocation — Startup projects target new users exploring the use of DesignSafe beyond the level of automatic allocations and/or planning to submit more substantial requests in the future as well as users who have modest requirements for the testbed that nonetheless can’t be met by local or institutional resources. Startup projects receive a fast track internal review. A Startup Allocation may request up to 50,000 SUs, and up to 1 terabyte of storage.\n\tResearch Allocation -- Research projects are designated for projects that have progressed beyond the startup phase and are conducting production usage of the infrastructure in pursuit of their research goals. Research allocations are subject to the full review process.\n\t\n\tA Research allocation has no mandatory maximum size; however, a maximum size of 2 million SUs (10% of the annual capacity of the system) and 100TB of data storage is recommended. Requests above this limit will be considered only in exceptional circumstances with additional justification, and it is recommended the requestor contact the project team to discuss the request before submitting.\n\tEducational Allocation — Education projects target faculty or teachers intending to use DesignSafe resources for classroom instruction or training classes related to cloud computing technologies. Educational Allocations receive fast track review. An Educational allocation may request up to 150,000 SUs and 1 terabyte of storage. This would be approximately equivalent to a 50 student training class allocating 64 processors per student for a 40 hour work week.\n\n\nEach of these allocation types is provided through NSF funding at no direct cost to the end user. Users who need additional allocation above what they are allocated, or who are not eligible for an NSF-provided allocation, may choose to purchase additional compute time or storage capacity from DesignSafe. These services will be provided based on the underlying cloud services rates in effect at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the time of purchase. As of this writing, storage is available for approximately $100/TB/year, and compute time is available for $0.0125 per core hour.\n\nAllocation Duration\n\nAllocations for DesignSafe resources are made for up to a 12-month period. PIs can continue their activities in subsequent years through annual renewal requests. At the end of each 12-month allocation period, projects forfeit any unused compute SUs. Users with a Startup Allocation need not wait the full 12 months to apply for a Research Allocation, and can apply as soon as they receive preliminary results suitable for their request. Educational Allocations will typically be limited in duration to the academic semester of the class in which they take place.\n\nReview Criteria for Additional Allocation Proposals\n\nDesignSafe supplemental allocations are reviewed for merit by a committee consisting of members of the Allocation Advisory Board. The board is made up of researchers in the academic community who are not part of the project team. The board makes recommendations to the project team based solely on the merit of the proposal, and not on overall availability of the resource. The board will review the proposal and make a recommendation to the project team based on the following criteria:\n\n\n\tScientific merit and significance of the proposed experiment.\n\tA methodology appropriate to the use of the DesignSafe resource.\n\tSuccess of prior or other existing allocations (for renewals) in terms of published research results and new funding.\n\tUse of other NHERI-funded facilities.\n\tAny funded support for the project (not required, but preference may be given to NSF supported projects using NHERI infrastructure; startup allocations can be made for exploratory research that has not yet attracted a source of funding).\n\n\nProposals that are deemed competitive by the Allocation Advisory Board are then reviewed by the project team for technical feasibility (i.e., can the project be implemented in the DesignSafe environment?) and for the availability of time on the resource. For Research Allocations, proposals will be reviewed at least once per quarter. Startup and Educational Allocation requests receive a fast track review, bypassing the Allocation Advisory Board. DesignSafe project staff will review these requests according to the merit review criteria above, and will act on these requests within two weeks of their submission.\n\nConflict of Interest and Confidentiality\n\nEvery effort is made to avoid conflicts of interest. Reviewers are not allowed to review or be present for the discussion of requests from their home institution, former students, postdocs, advisors, or current and recent collaborators. If in the opinion of a PI a certain individual has a conflict of interest, the PI may request that the individual not act as reviewer on their request. All reviews remain confidential and are made available only to the PI and Co-PIs submitting the request, assigned reviewers from the Allocation Advisory Board, DesignSafe project staff involved in the allocation review process, and NSF program officers for the DesignSafe project. While the contents of reviews and details of allocation requests and experiments remain confidential, a list of projects receiving allocations and the general area of research may be made public on the DesignSafe web site and used in project reports and presentations.\n\nRequest for an Allocation Advance\n\nIn some cases, a researcher might exhaust the available allocation in their Startup Allocation, and have a pressing need for additional allocation before their Research Allocation proposal can be reviewed. Similarly, researchers might have pressing needs while a renewal request is pending. In these instances, users can request an advance against a pending allocation proposal for up to 90 days. Advance request can be for up to 20% of the SUs requested in the proposal.\n\nSupplemental Requests\n\nA supplement is a request for additional resources during an existing allocation's one year time frame. Its purpose is to support changes in the original computational research plan that are required to achieve the scientific goals of the project. This may include altered or new goals, or support for projects proceeding more rapidly than anticipated or that require more resources than anticipated. Supplement awards are highly dependent upon availability of resources and limited to when allocation awards at the previous allocation period have been reduced to eliminate oversubscriptions. Supplements are not a mechanism to acquire additional resources for awards that were recommended for less than the amount originally requested. Supplemental requests require the filing of a progress report that documents what has been done with the originally awarded allocation, and makes the case for additional resources.\n\nExtension Requests\n\nExtensions of allocation periods beyond the normal 12-month duration can be requested through the portal. This request brings no new allocation, but keeps unused allocations from expiring. A brief reason is required for not using the awarded allocation, but no formal documentation is needed. Note that granting extension requests reduces the amount of allocation that can be given to users in the next year.\n\nAllocation Proposal Format\n\nA Startup Allocation request consists of the following components:\n\n\n\tPI Name, Title, and Organization\n\t(optional) Co-investigator names, titles, and organizations\n\tSummary of the proposed experiments (1 page maximum)\n\tEstimated resources required (include a short justification of the number and type of nodes you will request, and any specific software, hardware, or networking requirements. (1 page maximum)\n\tList any sources of funding (or pending funding) that support the proposed research, including funding agency and grant name(s) (Startup Allocations may be for unfunded exploratory research)\n\n\nAn Educational Allocation request consists of the following components:\n\n\n\tPI Name, Title, and Organization\n\t(optional) Co-investigator names, titles, and organizations\n\tSummary of the proposed course or training session to be supported, including the expected number of students who will participate (1 page maximum).\n\tEstimated resources required (include a short justification of the number and type of nodes you will request, and any specific software, hardware, or networking requirements. (1 page maximum)\n\tIf applicable, list any sources of funding that support the proposed course, including funding agency and grant name(s) (Educational Allocations do not require any external funding, but in cases where it does exist, the project would like to record any grants that are impacted by Chameleon).\n\n\nA Research Allocation request consists of the following components:\n\n\n\tPI Name, Title, and Organization\n\t(optional) Co-investigator names, titles, and organizations\n\tSummary of the proposed research (2 pages maximum).\n\tResults from any prior Allocations, including Startups.\n\t\n\t\tInclude a list of any publications resulting from these allocations, including conference presentations, technical reports, in preparation manuscripts, etc.\n\t\tInclude a list of any broader impacts, including students or postdocs trained, etc.\n\t\n\t\n\tEstimated resources required, which must include:\n\t\n\t\tA justification of the number and type of nodes you will request, and any specific software, hardware, or networking requirements. Wherever possible, justify this request with performance data from smaller scale experiments that validates the scope of the need (2 pages maximum)\n\t\n\t\n\tList any sources of funding (or pending funding) that support the proposed research, including funding agency and grant name(s).\n\tCVs (no page limit)\n\tReferences (optional, no page limit)\n\n\nDocument Formatting\n\nWhile readability is of greatest importance, documents must satisfy the following minimum requirements. Documents that conform to NSF proposal format guidelines will satisfy these guidelines.\n\n\n\tMargins: Documents must have 2.5-cm (1-inch) margins at the top, bottom, and sides.\n\tFonts and Spacing: The type size used throughout the documents must conform to the following three requirements:\n\n\nUse one of the following typefaces identified below:\n\n\n\tArial 11, Courier New, or Palatino Linotype at a font size of 10 points or larger;\n\tTimes New Roman at a font size of 11 points or larger; or\n\tComputer Modern family of fonts at a font size of 11 points or larger.\n\n\nA font size of less than 10 points may be used for mathematical formulas or equations, figures, table or diagram captions and when using a Symbol font to insert Greek letters or special characters. PIs are cautioned, however, that the text must still be readable.\n\n\n\tPage Numbering: Page numbers should be included in each file by the submitter.\n\n\nAllocation Limit per PI\n\nAn individual may be a PI on only one active DesignSafe allocation request at a given time. Several distinct research activities can be combined in a single allocation request, however, the allocation request for each activity must be justified, and any allocation-size limits apply to the aggregate request.\n\nThe single-allocation rule is designed to minimize the effort required by PIs for submitting allocation requests and the overhead to the process for reviewing those requests. While PIs may have several different funded grants that require computational support, these should be included as sub-sections within a single allocation request.\n\nThere are several exceptions to this rule:\n\n\n\tA PI may submit a Research request at any time during an active Startup allocation. A successful Research allocation will supersede any Startup allocations and start a new 12-month allocation period.\n\tIf a PI is leading an individual research activity as well as a community consortium activity or community service activity, separate requests for these distinct activities will be considered.\n\tA PI with active Startup or Research projects may submit requests for any number of Educational allocations to keep classroom and training users separate from research activities.\n\n\nSimilarly, to minimize the effort required to gain access to DesignSafe, closely collaborating researchers should submit a single collaborative allocation request rather than several individual requests. For example, a PI and associated post-doctoral researchers; investigators supported by the same funding grant; and researchers in the same lab group should consider submitting a request describing and justifying the various sub-activities. One of the collaborators is designated as the PI, and others can be designated as co-PIs.\n\nAcknowledgement of Support\n\nAn acknowledgement of support from the DesignSafe project and the National Science Foundation should appear in any publication of material, whether copyrighted or not, that describes work which benefited from access to DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure resources. For suggested language, see https://www.designsafe-ci.org/terms/\n\nGuidelines for a Successful Allocation Request\n\nWell-written research allocation requests will meet the following guidelines:\n\n\n\tThe research is summarized in context of the current state of the art; outlines the computational methods to be used; and relates those methods to subsections of the request.\n\tProvide sufficient information, without overwhelming details to the reviewers.\n\tThe justification for the request is clear, and closely coupled to the proposed experiments and needs, so that if the committee needs to reduce the original request, it can be done rationally with minimum disruption to the investigator.\n\tSummarize results from relevant previous allocations, including manuscripts published, accepted, submitted, or in preparation, and relate these results to the current request.\n\n\nThe purpose of DesignSafe is to accelerate research progress in natural hazards engineering and to provide cyber services to NHERI awardees. The purpose of the allocations policy is to insure the public investment in DesignSafe is used in the best and fairest possible way across the open research community, while making the request process as simple as possible. Following the principles above helps insure fast and fair decision making for this large public investment.\n\nThe project team is interested in receiving as many excellent requests as possible, and encourages any potential investigators who wish to use the resource to not hesitate in contacting the team for additional help in preparing this request, with questions about the process, or to discuss any type of project that may not fit the structure described here. The project team also welcomes input in improving this process, and encourages feedback on both this document and the process.\n ","django_id":"644","title":"Allocations Policy","url":"https://designsafe-ci.org/rw/user-guides/allocations-policy","text":"HPC &amp; Storage\nAllocations Policy\n\nIntroduction\n\nDesignSafe is a comprehensive cloud-based natural hazards research environment for experimental, theoretical, and computational engineering and science, providing a place to steward data from its creation through publication and archive, and also the workspace in which to understand, analyze, collaborate and publish that data, provided through funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The allocation policy for DesignSafe considers that users may have a range of use cases, ranging from short term analysis work to long term data storage, for very large or very small experiments. New use cases for DesignSafe may emerge—please don’t hesitate to contact the project team if you feel you have special circumstances not covered by this document. This document defines the policies governing allocations for compute time and storage on the DesignSafe platform. All registered users are provided a Base Allocation, as described below, and may request an additional Allocation for various purposes.\n\nWho is eligible for an Account?\n\nDesignSafe is broadly available to any researcher or practitioner working in open Natural Hazards Engineering research. By “open,” the expectation is that any research performed on DesignSafe is unclassified, and will result in publication in a broadly available journal or conference.\n\nWho is eligible for Allocations?\n\nA Base Allocation on DesignSafe is provided to all registered users. An additional Allocation on DesignSafe is headed by a project PI, typically a faculty member or researcher scientist at a US-based academic institution (private sector users are also welcome, see below). The PI may then add additional investigators, including students to their allocation at their discretion. PIs are responsible for insuring that any users added to their allocation comply with the terms and conditions for use of the DesignSafe resource. Collaborative projects involving non-U.S. researchers are encouraged as long as they include substantive intellectual participation by the U.S. researchers. In joint research projects, foreign collaborators are eligible to make use of that allocation in a manner consistent with the request.While a PI is typically a faculty member or researcher at an academic institution, there are a number of other cases where an individual may be eligible to be a PI:\n\n\n\tNSF Graduate Student Researcher Fellows: While in most cases, a graduate student is ineligible to be PI of an allocation request, an exception is made for NSF Graduate Student Fellows. Recipients of these NSF awards can submit requests for Startup allocations. Include supporting documentation (grant number or an award letter) as part of the request submission.\n\tOther federal agencies: Research staff employed by federal agencies or non-NSF FFRDCs are eligible to apply for an allocation if their agency or center does not typically provide research staff with access to resources of adequate scope for the planned research.\n\tState educational offices or organizations and local school districts may submit allocation requests intended to broaden the impact, accelerate the pace, and increase the effectiveness of improvements in science, mathematics, and engineering education in both K-12 and post-secondary levels. A teacher or educator at an accredited public or private K-12 school is eligible to apply for an allocation as PI.\n\tIndependent museums, observatories, libraries, research laboratories, professional societies and similar organizations in the United States that are directly associated with educational or research activities are eligible.\n\tU.S. commercial organizations, especially small businesses with strong capabilities in scientific or engineering research or education may apply for an allocation. The DesignSafe Project is interested in supporting projects that couple industrial research resources and perspectives with those of universities; therefore, it especially welcomes requests from cooperative projects involving both universities and the private commercial sector. It is necessary for these projects to submit their work in an open forum, and make the work readily available to the public.\n\n\nWhat are the units of an allocation and how am I charged?\n\nDesignSafe provides access to a variety of cloud-based computing and storage resources, accessible through several different interfaces (see the User Guide for an overview). A Base Allocation of compute time and storage is automatically provided to each user at the time they create an account. Users can request additional Allocations of computation time or data storage. Compute time is allocated in Service Units (SUs), which equates to one hour of wall clock time on a single processor core of time used. Compute time is charged on computations run through the Discovery Workspace via the web interface or through direct command line access to systems provided through DesignSafe. Storage is allocated and charged by the gigabyte-year, a gigabyte of physical storage for a one year time period.\n\nAdditional Service Unit Charges for Advanced Reservations\n\nThe basic principle for charging service units for DesignSafe resources is to evaluate the amount of time a fraction of the resource is unavailable to other users. If a reservation is made through the portal for a particular date/time in the future, the user will be charged for this time regardless of whether the reservation is actually used, as the DesignSafe scheduling system will have to drain the appropriate part of the system to satisfy the reservation, even if the nodes requested are not actually used.\n\nHow do I apply for an Additional Allocation?\n\nAdditional allocations may be requested via the DesignSafe Portal by submitting a . An application for an additional allocation includes information about the eligibility of the requestor, a description of the research to be performed and its sources of support, and a justification for the number of SUs requested.\n\nAllocation Sizes and Limits\n\nThere are four types of allocations available on DesignSafe:\n\n\n\tBase Allocation – Automatically issued to each user when their account is created. A Base Allocation provides up to 8,000 SUs and 50 gigabytes of storage. This is roughly equivalent to the use of a single processor core for one year.\n\tStartup Allocation — Startup projects target new users exploring the use of DesignSafe beyond the level of automatic allocations and/or planning to submit more substantial requests in the future as well as users who have modest requirements for the testbed that nonetheless can’t be met by local or institutional resources. Startup projects receive a fast track internal review. A Startup Allocation may request up to 50,000 SUs, and up to 1 terabyte of storage.\n\tResearch Allocation -- Research projects are designated for projects that have progressed beyond the startup phase and are conducting production usage of the infrastructure in pursuit of their research goals. Research allocations are subject to the full review process.\n\t\n\tA Research allocation has no mandatory maximum size; however, a maximum size of 2 million SUs (10% of the annual capacity of the system) and 100TB of data storage is recommended. Requests above this limit will be considered only in exceptional circumstances with additional justification, and it is recommended the requestor contact the project team to discuss the request before submitting.\n\tEducational Allocation — Education projects target faculty or teachers intending to use DesignSafe resources for classroom instruction or training classes related to cloud computing technologies. Educational Allocations receive fast track review. An Educational allocation may request up to 150,000 SUs and 1 terabyte of storage. This would be approximately equivalent to a 50 student training class allocating 64 processors per student for a 40 hour work week.\n\n\nEach of these allocation types is provided through NSF funding at no direct cost to the end user. Users who need additional allocation above what they are allocated, or who are not eligible for an NSF-provided allocation, may choose to purchase additional compute time or storage capacity from DesignSafe. These services will be provided based on the underlying cloud services rates in effect at the Texas Advanced Computing Center at the time of purchase. As of this writing, storage is available for approximately $100/TB/year, and compute time is available for $0.0125 per core hour.\n\nAllocation Duration\n\nAllocations for DesignSafe resources are made for up to a 12-month period. PIs can continue their activities in subsequent years through annual renewal requests. At the end of each 12-month allocation period, projects forfeit any unused compute SUs. Users with a Startup Allocation need not wait the full 12 months to apply for a Research Allocation, and can apply as soon as they receive preliminary results suitable for their request. Educational Allocations will typically be limited in duration to the academic semester of the class in which they take place.\n\nReview Criteria for Additional Allocation Proposals\n\nDesignSafe supplemental allocations are reviewed for merit by a committee consisting of members of the Allocation Advisory Board. The board is made up of researchers in the academic community who are not part of the project team. The board makes recommendations to the project team based solely on the merit of the proposal, and not on overall availability of the resource. The board will review the proposal and make a recommendation to the project team based on the following criteria:\n\n\n\tScientific merit and significance of the proposed experiment.\n\tA methodology appropriate to the use of the DesignSafe resource.\n\tSuccess of prior or other existing allocations (for renewals) in terms of published research results and new funding.\n\tUse of other NHERI-funded facilities.\n\tAny funded support for the project (not required, but preference may be given to NSF supported projects using NHERI infrastructure; startup allocations can be made for exploratory research that has not yet attracted a source of funding).\n\n\nProposals that are deemed competitive by the Allocation Advisory Board are then reviewed by the project team for technical feasibility (i.e., can the project be implemented in the DesignSafe environment?) and for the availability of time on the resource. For Research Allocations, proposals will be reviewed at least once per quarter. Startup and Educational Allocation requests receive a fast track review, bypassing the Allocation Advisory Board. DesignSafe project staff will review these requests according to the merit review criteria above, and will act on these requests within two weeks of their submission.\n\nConflict of Interest and Confidentiality\n\nEvery effort is made to avoid conflicts of interest. Reviewers are not allowed to review or be present for the discussion of requests from their home institution, former students, postdocs, advisors, or current and recent collaborators. If in the opinion of a PI a certain individual has a conflict of interest, the PI may request that the individual not act as reviewer on their request. All reviews remain confidential and are made available only to the PI and Co-PIs submitting the request, assigned reviewers from the Allocation Advisory Board, DesignSafe project staff involved in the allocation review process, and NSF program officers for the DesignSafe project. While the contents of reviews and details of allocation requests and experiments remain confidential, a list of projects receiving allocations and the general area of research may be made public on the DesignSafe web site and used in project reports and presentations.\n\nRequest for an Allocation Advance\n\nIn some cases, a researcher might exhaust the available allocation in their Startup Allocation, and have a pressing need for additional allocation before their Research Allocation proposal can be reviewed. Similarly, researchers might have pressing needs while a renewal request is pending. In these instances, users can request an advance against a pending allocation proposal for up to 90 days. Advance request can be for up to 20% of the SUs requested in the proposal.\n\nSupplemental Requests\n\nA supplement is a request for additional resources during an existing allocation's one year time frame. Its purpose is to support changes in the original computational research plan that are required to achieve the scientific goals of the project. This may include altered or new goals, or support for projects proceeding more rapidly than anticipated or that require more resources than anticipated. Supplement awards are highly dependent upon availability of resources and limited to when allocation awards at the previous allocation period have been reduced to eliminate oversubscriptions. Supplements are not a mechanism to acquire additional resources for awards that were recommended for less than the amount originally requested. Supplemental requests require the filing of a progress report that documents what has been done with the originally awarded allocation, and makes the case for additional resources.\n\nExtension Requests\n\nExtensions of allocation periods beyond the normal 12-month duration can be requested through the portal. This request brings no new allocation, but keeps unused allocations from expiring. A brief reason is required for not using the awarded allocation, but no formal documentation is needed. Note that granting extension requests reduces the amount of allocation that can be given to users in the next year.\n\nAllocation Proposal Format\n\nA Startup Allocation request consists of the following components:\n\n\n\tPI Name, Title, and Organization\n\t(optional) Co-investigator names, titles, and organizations\n\tSummary of the proposed experiments (1 page maximum)\n\tEstimated resources required (include a short justification of the number and type of nodes you will request, and any specific software, hardware, or networking requirements. (1 page maximum)\n\tList any sources of funding (or pending funding) that support the proposed research, including funding agency and grant name(s) (Startup Allocations may be for unfunded exploratory research)\n\n\nAn Educational Allocation request consists of the following components:\n\n\n\tPI Name, Title, and Organization\n\t(optional) Co-investigator names, titles, and organizations\n\tSummary of the proposed course or training session to be supported, including the expected number of students who will participate (1 page maximum).\n\tEstimated resources required (include a short justification of the number and type of nodes you will request, and any specific software, hardware, or networking requirements. (1 page maximum)\n\tIf applicable, list any sources of funding that support the proposed course, including funding agency and grant name(s) (Educational Allocations do not require any external funding, but in cases where it does exist, the project would like to record any grants that are impacted by Chameleon).\n\n\nA Research Allocation request consists of the following components:\n\n\n\tPI Name, Title, and Organization\n\t(optional) Co-investigator names, titles, and organizations\n\tSummary of the proposed research (2 pages maximum).\n\tResults from any prior Allocations, including Startups.\n\t\n\t\tInclude a list of any publications resulting from these allocations, including conference presentations, technical reports, in preparation manuscripts, etc.\n\t\tInclude a list of any broader impacts, including students or postdocs trained, etc.\n\t\n\t\n\tEstimated resources required, which must include:\n\t\n\t\tA justification of the number and type of nodes you will request, and any specific software, hardware, or networking requirements. Wherever possible, justify this request with performance data from smaller scale experiments that validates the scope of the need (2 pages maximum)\n\t\n\t\n\tList any sources of funding (or pending funding) that support the proposed research, including funding agency and grant name(s).\n\tCVs (no page limit)\n\tReferences (optional, no page limit)\n\n\nDocument Formatting\n\nWhile readability is of greatest importance, documents must satisfy the following minimum requirements. Documents that conform to NSF proposal format guidelines will satisfy these guidelines.\n\n\n\tMargins: Documents must have 2.5-cm (1-inch) margins at the top, bottom, and sides.\n\tFonts and Spacing: The type size used throughout the documents must conform to the following three requirements:\n\n\nUse one of the following typefaces identified below:\n\n\n\tArial 11, Courier New, or Palatino Linotype at a font size of 10 points or larger;\n\tTimes New Roman at a font size of 11 points or larger; or\n\tComputer Modern family of fonts at a font size of 11 points or larger.\n\n\nA font size of less than 10 points may be used for mathematical formulas or equations, figures, table or diagram captions and when using a Symbol font to insert Greek letters or special characters. PIs are cautioned, however, that the text must still be readable.\n\n\n\tPage Numbering: Page numbers should be included in each file by the submitter.\n\n\nAllocation Limit per PI\n\nAn individual may be a PI on only one active DesignSafe allocation request at a given time. Several distinct research activities can be combined in a single allocation request, however, the allocation request for each activity must be justified, and any allocation-size limits apply to the aggregate request.\n\nThe single-allocation rule is designed to minimize the effort required by PIs for submitting allocation requests and the overhead to the process for reviewing those requests. While PIs may have several different funded grants that require computational support, these should be included as sub-sections within a single allocation request.\n\nThere are several exceptions to this rule:\n\n\n\tA PI may submit a Research request at any time during an active Startup allocation. A successful Research allocation will supersede any Startup allocations and start a new 12-month allocation period.\n\tIf a PI is leading an individual research activity as well as a community consortium activity or community service activity, separate requests for these distinct activities will be considered.\n\tA PI with active Startup or Research projects may submit requests for any number of Educational allocations to keep classroom and training users separate from research activities.\n\n\nSimilarly, to minimize the effort required to gain access to DesignSafe, closely collaborating researchers should submit a single collaborative allocation request rather than several individual requests. For example, a PI and associated post-doctoral researchers; investigators supported by the same funding grant; and researchers in the same lab group should consider submitting a request describing and justifying the various sub-activities. One of the collaborators is designated as the PI, and others can be designated as co-PIs.\n\nAcknowledgement of Support\n\nAn acknowledgement of support from the DesignSafe project and the National Science Foundation should appear in any publication of material, whether copyrighted or not, that describes work which benefited from access to DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure resources. For suggested language, see https://www.designsafe-ci.org/terms/\n\nGuidelines for a Successful Allocation Request\n\nWell-written research allocation requests will meet the following guidelines:\n\n\n\tThe research is summarized in context of the current state of the art; outlines the computational methods to be used; and relates those methods to subsections of the request.\n\tProvide sufficient information, without overwhelming details to the reviewers.\n\tThe justification for the request is clear, and closely coupled to the proposed experiments and needs, so that if the committee needs to reduce the original request, it can be done rationally with minimum disruption to the investigator.\n\tSummarize results from relevant previous allocations, including manuscripts published, accepted, submitted, or in preparation, and relate these results to the current request.\n\n\nThe purpose of DesignSafe is to accelerate research progress in natural hazards engineering and to provide cyber services to NHERI awardees. The purpose of the allocations policy is to insure the public investment in DesignSafe is used in the best and fairest possible way across the open research community, while making the request process as simple as possible. Following the principles above helps insure fast and fair decision making for this large public investment.\n\nThe project team is interested in receiving as many excellent requests as possible, and encourages any potential investigators who wish to use the resource to not hesitate in contacting the team for additional help in preparing this request, with questions about the process, or to discuss any type of project that may not fit the structure described here. The project team also welcomes input in improving this process, and encourages feedback on both this document and the process.\n ","slug":"allocations-policy","django_ct":"cms.page","page_id":null,"id":"cms.page.644"}}

CFD based simulations provide information non-intrusively on quantities of interest at any location in the domain, whereas it is limited to only sensor locations in wind tunnels. In order to realize this potential, assurance of robustness and accuracy of numerical simulations is critical before the physical simulations in wind tunnels are relegated to simply validation of final designs. To usher new advances in the digital domain, the NSF’s NHERI SimCenter is designed to develop the next-generation of computational modeling and simulation software tools and web-enabled workflow management frameworks. These would be delivered to the community of users through Discovery Workspace at the NHERI’s CI Center DesignSafe.\n\nIn this context, the seminar will provide a rudimentary background of wind-structure interactions. This will be followed by a guided tour of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with a focus on wind engineering applications. The success in numerically capturing the complexity of massively separated flows around structures compounded by multi-scale fluctuations in the flow due to turbulence and their nonlinear interactions will be discussed in light of the main approaches central to CFD, i.e., RANS, LES and DNS. An overview of the relative success of CFD in aerospace engineering and the current state-of-the-art in wind engineering will be presented by delineating the differences in the approach flow conditions and the streamline nature of bodies versus bluff profiles. Also, CFD applications that integrate other emerging computational and machine learning tools will be presented in examples of shape optimization of structural form, uncertainty quantification and multi-fidelity modeling will be presented.\n\nThe raison d'être for NHERI’s wind tunnel EF sites in digital world remains essential as the success of future CFD based tools relies heavily on their validation through carefully designed experiments. The wind tunnels may also provide a large number of datasets involving a host of structural configurations and surrounding environments, identified statistically based on design of experiments, as a cloud of data that may be used for metamodeling and machine learning or aiding in enhancing the quality of computations. The juxtaposition of wind tunnels and CFD under NHERI would lead to more synergies and eventual maturation of the computational tools so that they become daily design office tools. Currently, in Japan, designers are permitted to use CFD in lieu of wind tunnels under the guidance of an expert. This may lead the way to the promising new world of digital design with literally unbounded opportunities.\n\n \n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nAhsan Kareem\nRobert M Moran Professor of Engineering\nDirector NatHaz Modeling laboratory\n\nAhsan Kareem is the Robert M.

As well it provides experimental data which can be used to validate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods for predicting aerodynamic loads and other computational methods for predicting structural response.  Its capabilities to accommodate large test specimens and scale models, to cover a wide speed range (0 – 70 m/s), and to undertake destructive tests, have also been used to gain better understanding of failure mechanisms, including aeroelastic instability, and to develop practical mitigation methods for alleviating the effects of wind storms. It has been used to provide data for structural specialists exploring the performance of building structures in the elastic range and beyond the point of first yield, thereby gaining an improved understanding of the serviceability and true strength reserves of buildings. This is useful information for future designs with smaller carbon footprints and for assessing buildings undergoing rehabilitation.  The Wall of Wind also has the capability to generate rain with wind which is useful for research into water infiltration through building envelopes and development of improved designs and testing standards.  The keynote talk will give examples of research projects and illustrate the Wall of Wind’s wide range of capabilities to advance basic knowledge as well as develop practical solutions for mitigating the effects of wind storms and related hazards.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\n\nPeter Irwin\nWall of Wind Professor of Practice\nRWDI, Senior Executive Consultant and Founding Partner\n\n\nPeter A.

SimCenter senior personnel discussed the use of simulation for hazards including earthquake, tsunami, wind, and storm surge. Additionally, illustrative case studies and workflows in four topic areas were presented:\n\n\n\tUncertainty Quantification – Structural/ Solid Mechanics\n\tUncertainty Quantification – Computational Fluid Dynamics\n\tPerformance-Based Engineering – Facilities\n\tPerformance-Based Engineering – Regional Systems\n\n\nAfternoon break-out sessions with working groups focusing on the four topic areas enabled participants to discuss and develop specific user requirements, data definitions, and workflow drafts specific to the topic areas.\n\nThe entire group of nearly 40 participants reconvened to present summary reports from the break-out sessions and to discuss action items from the day’s meeting.\n\n“We had high expectations before today’s meeting, and this meeting exceeded those expectations. The diversity of intellectual thinking from established researchers, early career researchers, and practitioners fueled many ideas and indicated consensus on tasks that the SimCenter is working on,” said Steve Mahin, SimCenter principal investigator. “Furthermore, the numerous use-cases identified during this meeting illustrated the value of the SimCenter’s role to transform research.
