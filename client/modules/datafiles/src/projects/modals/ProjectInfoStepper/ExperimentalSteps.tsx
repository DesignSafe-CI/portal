      DesignSafe offers an interactive interface to curate and publish data with
      other project members. Curation is important so your data can be
      organized, discovered, and understood for years to come.
    </p>
    <p>The four components of curation:</p>
    <div style={{ marginLeft: '18px' }}>
      <div>
        <strong>Experiments</strong> contain all the files you want to publish
        under a single DOI.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Categories</strong> group files together based on shared purpose
        in an experiment.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Related Data</strong> shows the relationship within categories
        and to an experiment.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>File Tags</strong> are agreed upon terms from the community for
        individual files.
      </div>
    </div>
    <p></p>

      sensor instrumentation used in a model configuration to conduct one or
      more event.

    <div>
      <span className="category-yellow">Event</span>: Files from unique
      occurrences during which data are generated.

      visualizations, Jupyter Notebooks, or other representations of the
      results.

      <strong>File Tags</strong> are custom or agreed-upon terms from the
      community for describing files or directories. Using agreed-upon tags
      helps other researchers refine their search and discovered specific files
      in your publication. The natural hazards community has contributed to
      creating the agreed-upon terms.

    <h3>Best Practices</h3>
    <hr />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Publish data files in a format that is interoperable and open. Example:
        CSV instead of SAS files
      </li>
      <li>
        Before publishing raw data that has not been processed, consider why it
        is necessary. If so, explain how others can use the raw data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be selective with any images you choose. Use file tags to describe them.
        Make sure they have a purpose or a function.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not publish ZIP files. ZIP files prevent others from viewing and
        understanding your data.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use applicable software to review for any errors in your data before you
        publish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid publishing data within folders. Instead, provide a direct view to
        the data within collections so others can understand your project at a
        glance.
