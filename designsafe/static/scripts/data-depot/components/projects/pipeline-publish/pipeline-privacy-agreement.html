                Guidelines Regarding the Storage and Publication of Protected Data in DesignSafe-CI
            </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Researchers should always comply with the requirements, norms and procedures approved 
                by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or equivalent body, regarding human subjects’
                data storage and publication.
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>Protected data</i> includes human subjects data with Personal Identifiable Information (PII),
                data that is protected under
                <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html" target="_blank">HIPPA</a>,
                <a href="https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/what-ferpa" target="_blank">FERPA</a> and
                <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/detailed-overview" target="_blank">FISMA</a>
                regulations, as well as data that involves vulnerable populations and that contains
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_sensitivity" target="_blank">sensitive information</a>.
            </p>
            <div class="overview-heading">Storing Protected Data</div>
            <p>
                DesignSafe My Data and My Projects are secure spaces to store raw protected data as
                long as it is not under HIPPA, FERPA or FISMA regulations. If data needs to comply with
                these regulations, researchers must contact DesignSafe through a
                <a href="/help/new-ticket/" target="_blank">help ticket</a>
                to evaluate the case and use
                <a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/protected-data-service" target="_blank">TACC‘s Protected Data Service</a>.
                Researchers with doubts are welcome to send a
                <a href="/help/new-ticket/" target="_blank">ticket</a> or join

            <div class="overview-heading">Publishing Protected Data</div>
            <p>
                To publish protected data researchers should adhere to the following procedures:
            </p>
            <p>
                1.  Do not publish HIPPA, FERPA, FISMA, PII data or other sensitive information in DesignSafe.
            </p>
            <p>
                2.  To publish protected data and any related documentation (reports, planning documents,
                field notes, etc.) it must be properly anonymized. No <i>direct identifiers</i> and up to
                three <i>indirect identifiers</i> are allowed. <i>Direct identifiers</i> include items such
                as participant names, participant initials, facial photographs (unless expressly authorized
                by participants), home addresses, social security numbers and dates of birth. <i>Indirect identifiers</i>
                are identifiers that, taken together, could be used to deduce someone’s identity. Examples of
                <i>indirect identifiers</i> include gender, household and family compositions, occupation,
                places of birth, or year of birth/age.
            </p>
            <p>
                3.  If a researcher needs to restrict public access to data because it includes HIPPA, FERPA,
                PII data or other sensitive information, consider publishing metadata and other documentation
                about the data.
            </p>
            <p>
                4.  Users of DesignSafe interested in the data will be directed to contact the project PI or
                designated point of contact through a published email address to request access to the data
                and to discuss the conditions for its reuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                5.  Please contact DesignSafe through a
                <a href="/help/new-ticket/" target="_blank">help ticket</a> or join
                <a href="/learning-center/training/" target="_blank">curation office hours</a>
