    <h1>DesignSafe-CI Google Drive Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p class="lead">
        By connecting your Google Drive account to DesignSafe, you consent to giving DesignSafe <strong>read</strong> and
        <strong>write</strong> access to your Google Drive account. DesignSafe makes a secure connection to
        your Google Drive account to list your data in the Data Depot, and to copy data to and from the DesignSafe's
        data servers.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        We request this level of scope access (as opposed to read-only) to give you the best user experience,
        allowing you to upload field data and simulation results directly to your Google Drive, while also viewing and using these files
        in experimental workflows by copying data from Google Drive to a directory you own in the Data Depot.
    </p>

    <p class="alert alert-info">
        We do not store any personal or identifying information from your Google Drive account, other than an access token
         and related file metadata, which is limited to mimeType, name, id, modifiedTime, fileExtension, size, and parents.
