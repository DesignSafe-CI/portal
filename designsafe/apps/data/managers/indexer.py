class AgaveIndexer(object):
    """Indexer class for all indexing needs.

    This class helps when indexing files/folders into elasticsearch.
    A file/folder needs to be indexed after any change except for content changes.
    Meaning, when a file/folder is created, renamed, moved, etc.

    It is recommended to call any of this class' methods in a celery task.
    This is because most of the indexing operations take a
    considerable amount of time.

    This class retrieves the agave client using ``ds_admin`` credentials in order to
    try and normalize the permission's object returned by Agave.

    **Disclaimer**: A class is used to pack all this functionality together.
    This is not necessary and these methods should, probably, live in a separate
    module. The decision to leave this class here, for now, is because of the close
    relation the indexing operations have with the :class:`filemanager` operations.

    **Generators**:

        There are two generators implemented in this class
        :meth:`walk` and :meth:`walk_levels`. The functionality of these generators
        is based on :meth:`os.walk` and their intended use is the same.

        :meth:`walk_levels` is similar to :meth:`os.walk`. This is the prefered
        method to walk an Agave filesystem.

        :meth:`walk` differs from the regular :meth:`os.walk` in that it returns
        a single file on every iteration instead of lists of `files` and `folders`.
        This implementation is mainly legacy and was the first approach to walking
        an agave filesyste that we tried. It is recommended to use
        :meth:`walk_levels` since it is more efficient. :met:`walk` can
        still be used, preferably, if the folder to walk is small.

    **Indexing**:

        There are three different methods for indexing :meth:`index`, :meth:`index_full`
        and :met:`index_permissions`. The speration is necessary due to the number of
        calls necessary to get all the information needed. If we want to retrieve
        all the information for a specific file from agave (file information and
        permissions) we need to to a `files.listing` call and a `files.pems` call.

        Retrieving the permissions is a separate call because Agave calculates
        the permissions of a file based on different rules stored in the database.
        This need for two calls drives us to use **"optimistic permissions"** when ever
        possible. **"optimistic permissions"** is when we assume who the owner of the
        file is going to be and create a permission object with the owner's username
        instead of making another call to Agave. The owner's username is extracted
        from the target file path. We assume a file path of $HOME/path/to/file.txt
        where $HOME will always be the username of the owner.

    .. note:: It is recommended to not instantiate this class directly.
        The :class:`FileManager` class will count with an instance
        of this class:
        >>> mgr = FileManager(user_obj)
        >>> #do indexing stuff
        >>> mgr.indexer.index(...)

        ------

            Similar to :meth:`os.walk` the `files` and `folders` list can be
            modified inplace to modify future iterations. Modifying the
            `files` and `folders` lists inplace can be used to tell the
            generator of any modifications done with every iteration.
            This only makes sense when `bottom_up` is `False`. Any inplace
            change to the `files` or `folders` list when `bottom_up` is
            `True` it will not affect the behaviour of the yielded objects.

        Notes
        -----

            In order to get all the documents that are children of the given path
            we use a search that searches on `path._path` property of the document
            this is set with a hierarchy tokenizer.

            This means that with one search we can get all the children documents
            of a given path in one call, but they are not necessarily going
            to be sorted. In order to sort the files we sort them by the length
            of their paths. This is not necessarily correct but it is good enough
            for updating permissions.
