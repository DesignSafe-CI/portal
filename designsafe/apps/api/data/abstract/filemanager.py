class AbstractFileManager:
    """
    Abstract Class to implement a data File Manager for different resources.
    A FileManager class should subclass this class.
    Notes: 
        - This is supported by python 2.6+ and in 3.2+ we can also 
          use @abstractclassmethod
        - Arguments are not enforced by abstract classes.
        - Subclasses of this class are called from the main class based data 
          views in `designsafe.apps.api.data.view` as such:
        >>> #fm is an instance of the corresponding AbstracFileManager subclass
        >>> op = getattr(fm, operation)
        >>> op(**kwargs)

        - All required arguments are passed as `kwargs` dictionary. This means 
          that you can implement the required method adding the necessary 
          method arguments, e.g.:
        >>> def file(self, file_id, action, path, **kwargs):

        Lists contents of a folder or details of a file.
        When the main data view calls this method it will send all the keyword 
        arguments as **kwargs. This means that `file_id` will be the URL path 
        call after the necessary routing parts have been removed, i.e. It will 
        not contain the host, operation type or resource type.

        Main method to manage a folder or file.
        See the `listing` method for reference of `file_id`.
        When the main data view calls this method it will send all the keyword 
        arguments as **kwargs. 
        If the HTTP Request is of type POST or GET the `kwargs` dictionary will 
        contain the `request.boy` data (given it's a valid JSON object) as well 
        as the uploaded files in the key `files` if any.

        Notes:
            - This method should route all the necessary file specific operations:
              - move
              - rename
              - copy
              - delete
              An example is given below. The type of action should be in the request 
              body JSON object. If it's necessary to specify another filepath for the 
              operation this should also be part of the request JSON body with the 
              key `path`. For instance, when copying a file the request JSON 
              body object should look like this:
              {
                  "action": "copy",
