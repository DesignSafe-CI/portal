# This compose file should be used to build the next release
# wether it's a prod or dev release, we should use this file to biuld the image.
#
# Rationale:
# The Dockerfile does not lives in the root directory, hence it is easier to set
# the correct context with docker-compose.
# Also, this is a non-obtrusive way to keep track of the last release made either to dev/qa or prod..
# We are tagging dev/qa releases and prod releases. In order to navigate the release
# history, one should look at the tags in the repository.
